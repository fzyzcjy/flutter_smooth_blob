### Correct the unit of file size from "kb" (maybe "kilo bits") to "KB"

The error message when enabling "invert oversized images" tells us how many extra space the image uses. That is quite helpful! However, when I read `...an additional 1234kb...`I thought that means kilo *bits* (since in network programming `kb` and `kB` are definitely different and should be taken with care). However, after reading the source code, I suddenly realized that it is kilo *bytes*. Thus, this PR is here to ensure that people do not misunderstand the unit.

@goderbauer Thanks! I only change 2 characters in a literal String, so I am a bit confused why it the tests are failed... I have looked at the CI logs, but seems no clues (since I am not very familiar with all the infrastructures of Flutter). Could you please give some hints?

There appear to be tests that verify the error message you're modifying. You can probably reproduce this locally by going into the `packages/flutter` directory and running `flutter test` there.

### Fix duplicated documentation

Hi thanks for the lib! When reading doc, I find:

> If multiple draw commands intersect with the clip boundary, this can result multiple draw commands intersect with the clip boundary, this can result in incorrect blending at the clip boundary.

That sounds like a typo (duplicated doc line) so I fixed it ;)

This pull request was opened against a branch other than _main_. Since Flutter pull requests should not normally be opened against branches other than main, I have changed the base to main. If this was intended, you may modify the base back to master. See the [Release Process](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Release-process) for information about how other branches get updated.

__Reviewers__: Use caution before merging pull requests to branches other than main, unless this is an intentional hotfix/cherrypick.

### Fix typo (again)

*Replace this paragraph with a description of what this PR is changing or adding, and why. Consider including before/after screenshots.*

Given my understanding of flutter, seems that we need to wait until next stable (which is roughly 2 months later, unfortunately) if it is not in 2.10. Or, we may make a cherry-pick request

### [Proposal]Let Flutter run animations at 60fps even if there are heavy widgets, possibly using React Fiber-like or suspend-like algorithm?

EDIT: Design proposal https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FuNcBvAPghUyjeqQCOYxSt6lGDAQ1YxsNlOvrUx0Gko/edit?usp=sharing

---

Below (folded) are the initial proposal. However, I have realized the initial proposal has many drawbacks, and have raised new proposals. For example, [the dual isolate](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101227#issuecomment-1249005541) (click to view that comment).

<details>

Hi thanks for the framework! As we all know, React Fiber improves the performance and smoothness of React. Currently I am also observing some jank for Flutter app even after optimizing it using the tooltips in official doc, and I do hope there can be something similar to Fiber in Flutter side.

p.s. Some doc about react fiber: https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture

I am interested in making contribution when having time as well.

In general, we are moving to a state where all PRs have to use the "Waiting for tree to go green" label to get submitted. I seem to recall a requirement that developers need 2 approving reviews from authorized reviewers to be eligible to be pushed, but I don't see the checks asking for that. I'll add the label and see if it goes in.

If the bot comes along and removes the label, then tag @dnfield to complete a review and then the label should work.

Note that for now the tree is broken (the "luci-engine" failure in the list) so the label is currently in a wait state on that condition.

> if I understand correctly you compare reconciling DOMs to rebuilding the elements in a widget tree
and you are proposing to rebuild only certain elements the same way react-fiber prioritize

Possibly not only Widget build, but also layout, paint, etc. Since it is often the case that the layout/paint cost time.

> give the developer the ability to set a widgets to low rendering priority

Sounds reasonable.

@maheshmnj Hi thanks for the reply.

I have made an attempt about doing async rendering *without modifying* Flutter framework: https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_smooth_render But the result is not very interesting - seems that we really need to dig into the framework itself instead of making a wrapper layer around it.

I still don't see anything rendered in the erode test even if I click on it to see it full size. Am I clicking on the wrong link?

Actually, it looks like I was reviewing the goldens from before I requested a larger stroke width. Maybe they haven't been updated yet?

I guess the CI is even not executed after modifying strokewidth...

Not to test indeed, but to inform. Firstly, in https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_convenient_test readme, there is a 1-minute video demonstrating how this open source lib looks like. Then you see this lib shows errors etc in the command panel in an intuitive way for the programmers. When talking about "errors", surely we want to show stack traces as well, but currently for errors like golden mismatch I have to use takeException and stacktrace is lost.

Where this lib needs it: https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_convenient_test/blob/f9d38c9fd870a5dab5a61755f66214b29caadf2f/packages/convenient_test_dev/lib/src/functions/command.dart#L99

It is a little odd to expose that here and may lead to confusion in the API. Have you considered just overwriting `FlutterError.onError` in your framework yourself to catch the error directly?

I think that is by design. You can override it for the given test, or even use `setUp` to override it for a `group` of tests.

That seems not possible, surprisingly. Because FlutterError.onError is overrided in `TestWidgetsFlutterBinding._runTest`, which seems to be run after all setup?

### Fix that RenderEditable (TextField) ignores offset in painting, making text selections shifted when offset is nonzero

**I will start adding tests once flutter team thinks this PR is acceptable, since I am not sure whether the team like to fix it, and if the team does not like it I will not waste time on it :)**

---

When implementing `RenderBox.paint`, we know we should respect the `offset` parameter. However, even though `_paintContents` respects it, the `_paintHandleLayers` does not - instead it completely ignores the offset parameter. This is logically wrong as it does not respect the definition and requirements of the function.

Luckily (or unluckily), currently it does not have *visible* harm *yet*. This is because `RenderEditable` is used by `_Editable` and future by `EditableText`. And, the `_Editable`'s ancestors widgets do not provide any offset (because the widgets in the same Layer paint child without shifting). Thus, `offset` parameter is always zero in the *current* version of Flutter.

However, I am still proposing this PR because of the following reasons:

1. It is logically wrong (violates definition of `paint`), so by definition it is a bug and we should fix it.
2. It may be a visible bug in future releases. With adding more functionality to text fields, surely we cannot guarantee RenderEditable's ancestors always give a zero offset. (If we think so, I should immediately raise another PR with `assert(offset==Offset.zero)` to enforce it.)
3. Users who need deep customization may directly use `RenderEditable` (since it is public), and even copy some of the source code and hack it (e.g. me). With their customizations, it is highly possible that the offset is no longer always zero, then they will find suddenly the text selections shifted weirdly. (Disclaimer: That is my case, and why I find this bug)

I have not come up with a way to make tests about this, because `_Editable` is private, and as mentioned above, it is logically wrong but not visible now.
However, this PR does not add any new logic, so making existing tests pass IMHO may be sufficient.

### Improve performance by removing redundant null checks on hot paths

As we know, `RenderObject.constraints` field is called frequently, because every `performLayout` usually reads that. However, by looking at the code, it seems that it is having a redundant null check, which reduces the performance.

### Link `debugVisitOnstageChildren` in `Offstage`

The Offstage has strong relationship with debugVisitOnstageChildren: When using Offstage widget, the widget subtree of debugVisitOnstageChildren is changed, and widget testers will not find an offstage widget. In addition, when we are talking about the word "offstage", we may need to refer to both pages, because they have slightly different meanings.

This origins partially from https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/111479#issuecomment-1245534877. Indeed, when talking about "offstage widgets", I quickly remembered and opened Offstage page, but never realize there is another page about debugVisitOnstageChildren, which even has a bit different explanation from Offstage. This PR fixes this problem.

As mentioned earlier, I am willing to PR and contribute. But surely need some suggestions and discussions prior to start implementing :)

Btw I am not thinking about strictly implementing Fiber, since web model is not the same as Flutter model, but something inspired by it that can make our animations smoother.

I think so. Maybe we can create a document and then a detailed description
- the fiber node archive and it can be interrupted by reconciler
- how does the Fiber reconciler work
- how does the flutter framework need to do and how to design

How do you think about it? @fzyzcjy

Sure! Maybe we can firstly discuss about it (maybe just here? - just like how I have seen many Dart/Flutter design discussions happen) and a detailed doc after we draw a (draft) conclusion

> how does the flutter framework need to do and how to design

Btw, fiber can make animations smoother, but if I understand correctly, the smoothness is because that specific animation is driven by css, not js. This is contrary to flutter. For example, a CircularProgressIndicator, or even a scrolling of ListView, is driven by Dart code. Thus, we cannot easily say "let's give control to flutter engine / android / ios / whatever once in a while when we are doing build/layout/paint/whatever". If we simply do so, we will not get a smooth animation automatically. Instead, we may need to find out a more sophisticated approach.

Yes, the CSS animation is driven by css, not through js
That mean, the CSS associated with the HTML element can calculate the animation difference directly, without going through JS. @fzyzcjy

Yes, that is why fiber is so useful. Indeed it is like, the web ui is driven by two things - the JS and CSS. Fiber pause JS once in a while so CSS things can come in and animate.

As you say, Web animation like css animate, Android ViewPropertyAnimator (maybe iOS also has similar animate mechanism), they all are driven by browser/system, but in Flutter it is driven by ourselves with all other business logic.

for more, Android's window transition animation is driven by WindowService seperately

@JsouLiang @xanahopper 

So, it is possible we come up with something slightly different?

For example, if we want to make some animations faster, like CircularProgressIndicator and ListView-scrolling, is it possible to do the following: We give CircularProgressIndicator high priority, and it must be layout/paint at 60fps. In the meanwhile, all other widgets will run one layout/paint across multiple frames with suspending just like what Fiber does. In other words, when vsync comes, CircularProgressIndicator will do all the layout/paint job, while other widgets will continue working on its layout/paint but will pause once it is near 16ms. Then, we can see CircularProgressIndicator smooth at 60fps, while other widgets having similar rendering speed as before.

Btw, some side remarks that is less like Fiber: Here is a tool that defers Widgets from being built https://github.com/LianjiaTech/keframe. But I guess we can make it more fine-grained and with more improvements since we are going to modify the flutter framework itself. For example, (very rough draft idea), can we modify the layout phase (or paint, or others), such that it pauses layouting the remainder (and will do it in the next frame), and let painting and other phases go first?

@fzyzcjy I'm interested in this topic and have been trying to go in a direction where Keframe can make the best use of each 16.7ms, since now each item will take the full 16.7ms (even though it may only take 1ms on some good devices). I'm trying to count the time taken by individual items to determine how many items should be rendered in the next frame.

Continue from the animation proposal above, with @dnfield's "without breaking existing Framework code":

Maybe we can have a global flag, say, `bool enableFiber = false`. By default it is false, so users can use existing API freely without any change. When user manually set it to true, our new feature runs.

The API may be as simple as a Widget, say, `HighPrioritySubTree(builder: (context, child) => build_your_subtree_here, child: put_static_child_here)`, just like animation builder widgets. That builder should wrap the CircularProgressIndicator in the example above. We may also add a `CancelHighPrioritySubTree` if needed. For example, when scrolling ListView, we may want the scrolling animation be at 60fps, while we have to accept that a big widget in ListView is slow to build. Then, we may wrap ListView with HighPrioritySubTree, and each child of ListView with CancelHighPrioritySubTree. By doing so, our ListView will be forcefully built at each frame, while its contents will be stale for a few frames.

@Nayuta403 I have had similar thoughts before. The problem is, `build` phase is not the most costly one. There are `layout` and `paint` phase, etc, as well. What's worse, Flutter has C++ engine code which rasterizes and flush to the screen. That one can take a long time in some cases (for example, in my own app, when there is a ton of bezier curves). A widget may, for example, have very short `build` phase time but very long C++ rasterize time.

@fzyzcjy I agree with switch flag, but some individual widget may still look verbose. I'd rather like to add a optional parameter to base class `Widget` to specify it's build/layout/render priority.
Than change default page transition widget, scrollable container to high priority and wrap its content to low priority.

And here is another case may need to be consider: the list.
 in general container such as page, content size has no effect with container and other siblings, but things are different in list.
if we have different size of different item, we cannot just show placeholder with same size, scrolling when and after content item is building/layouting may cause a sudden change in list.

That sounds good to me. With that flag, we can also very easily create the widgets I mention. Just like the repaintBoundary is a flag and we create a widget to set it.

That's true. `keframe` workaround by letting the developer specify a placeholder size *manually*. But surely, for complex list items, we can never predict the size in advance so it still "jumps" when real content loads.

Maybe this is inevitable, and we have to live with it? Or, maybe we just place background color on those non-built entries?

I remember that iOS has very high priority with scrolling. If we can get item's size before build, this may not be a problem.

pre-measure for many things is possible but we have two considerations:
- it cannot block UI/main thread otherwise it means nothing
- it should has slice cost for developer to do that

this may conflict with principle of Flutter for single pass measure……but I think it has already has many cases in practice against that, it may not be a big deal.

@xanahopper I am not sure whether that is another isolated problem, or we can directly solve it within our proposal about this issue. For example, if we are to add a pre-measure phase, we may add computeSomething in addition to existing computeLayout, computeDryLayout etc, and that may be orthogonal to this issue.

Btw, I suspect whether pre-measure can happen before `build` phase, since we even do not know the widget tree then. Maybe it can happen before `layout` phase?

Just to make it a little bit more detailed: On the contrary, if my proposal above works, the following may happen -

1. Animations are in perfect 60fps, since low-priority job auto pause when near timeout. If we use keframe or similar solution, and give too many widgets in one frame, our animation will stuck.
2. No cpu cycles are wasted, because we will never early-pause but will only pause when near timeout. For example, suppose widget A needs 160ms to build+layout+paint+raster, then it will be done in (roughly) 10 frames. If we use keframe or similar solution, and give too little widgets in one frame, we are wasting cpu cycles.
3. It avoids our need to measure, or guess, the time needed for a widget in build/layout/paint/raster phase. Just as I mentioned above, I personally find it hard to guess how long a widget will need in those phases, especially raster phase which is C++ and varies greatly on different CPU/GPUs (different phones).
4. It is OK to have a non-separable widget that is heavy in one phase.
5. It is automatic and declarative. Programmers only need to specify priorities and that's all.

Btw I also like your (@Nayuta403) keframe solution :) Just trying to propose something that we can make flutter even better

@fzyzcjy  Thank you, I think we all want to make Flutter better. ❤️

So I think of a few problems we might have to solve: 
1. How to get the current UI cost, I think we still need to know this information even if we put the animation in the high priority queue, so that we can determine when the low priority task should end. 
2. How does the ListVIew item handle sliding when there is no width and height information 
3. How Fiber builds interruptible. It might be a little easier for a ListVIew, because its items are siblings. But what about parent-child nodes like Container?

<DiscussionComment author="fzyzcjy" link="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101227" source="github" createTime="2022-09-15T06:10:03Z">

More thoughts here.

#### 1. For CircularProgressIndicator, or high-priority widgets without low-priority children

A very draft idea:

We may have multiple sub-trees, i.e. have a forest, in flutter. In this example, CircularProgressIndicator may be subtree 1, and everything else may be subtree 2. The subtree 1 goes through build/layout/paint/raster etc for each frame, and subtree 2 may go slowly, i.e. suspend.

Suppose it needs 10 frames for subtree 2 to finish the whole build/layout/paint/raster process. Then, we just allow all inconsistent and dirty states to exist during that 10 frames. For example, a node may have several layouted children and several un-layouted children. Same goes for rasterizing etc. We also need to ensure nobody can mutate the state accidentally when they are dirty.

In addition, I think we may not need to add this suspend feature to the `build` phase, but only add to layout/paint/raster if possible, contrary to React. This is because, if the time-consuming operation is only at build phase, keframe or similar solutions should already work. It may be deep in the rendering pipeline that makes this proposed method more interesting.

Surely this is just a draft and brainstorm, and I am willing to hear any thoughts!

#### 2. For ListView scrolling problem, or high-priority widgets with low-priority children

The problem is, those big low-priority children may need a lot of frames (say 10 frames) to build/layout/paint/rasterize, and during those 10 frames, their internal data structure are not ready for use. For example, we cannot let it to paint at 5th frame, because its layout tree (or layer tree or something like that) may have a child that has been layouted and another child that has not yet been layouted.

However, we are doing nothing but scrolling. Then what about simply *raster cache* the screen, and scrolling is nothing but shifting this `ui.Image`. More details can mimic this PR: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/106621 In that PR, during a "zoom page transition", no real widgets are built in each frame. Instead, a `ui.Image` snapshot is taken in the first frame, and during the whole transition we are just zooming that Image. Our solution is different from #106621, though. In that PR, no work is done during the whole page transition, but in our case, we can perform useful build/layout/paint/raster in the remaining time of each frame.

This solution also has some spirit similar to React Fiber: In Fiber, our JS-driven DOM elements are freezed indeed, and it is the CSS animation that still works. In our case, the "scrolling ui.Image" is a bit mimic a scrolling CSS animation.

Seems we do not need? We just blindly run whatever should be done next, and suspend when we are near 16ms.

We do need to let the the high priority job (say CircularProgressIndicator or ListView-scrolling) finish within the totally 16ms though.

My first thought is that, it would be best if we execute *all phases* of *this subtree* first, and then execute (and suspend when timeout) all phases of the second subtree in whatever time remain. Then we never need to get the cost.

If that is impossible, I wonder whether we can use some heuristics. We all know a CircularProgressIndicator should be very lightweight, so is a ListView-scrolling (if using the ui.Image approach above). We may also learn from the history.

If using the approach mentioned above, it will just be blank. But not blank whenever there is a scrolling! Because we know Flutter has some cache extent for ListViews, we can also capture those cached extents in our `ui.Image` snapshot. Then, only if the following happens, we will see blank:

1. The user scrolls so much that all cache extent are used up
2. Our heavy widgets are so heavy that it even does not finish one frame up to now

As a very rough draft, I am considering `yield`. For example:

```dart
Iterable<void> performLayout() sync* {
  yield* myFirstChild.layout();
  some_computation_here;
  yield* mySecondChild.layout();
}
```

Each yield point is suspendable.

IIRC, Redux Saga https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/introduction/BeginnerTutorial/ uses something similar to this.

Have not digged into React Fiber's source code yet. Have you checked it, how does it implement it?

But as I am not an expert in Dart compiler implementation, I am not sure about the performance penalty. (Hope it to be tiny!)

A few pointers:

- We cannot use sync generators, they create code that is large and slow. 
- A good canonical case here would be something like https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/dev/benchmarks/macrobenchmarks/lib/src/list_text_layout.dart. This ends up being janky because layout gets expensive for all that text (on a lower end phone it can easily take 20-30+ms just to layout all the text there, and the ListTile is a little deceptive because Material introduces expense - this is the kind of thing we want to figure out how to break up "automatically").
- We should probably worry about prioritization of jobs until after we figure out how to sensibly budget and interrupt layout/painting/compositing. It doesn't matter what priority we'd want to give things if we can't do that, and it will probably be hard to come up with a good/fair prioritization scheme.

Quick answer to budget: As suggested in my comments above, we may not need to budget things (unlike the keframe-like solution). We just run the high-priority subtree (one with animation) until it finishes, and then run low-priority heavy subtree until whenever timeouts.

Well, I mean, run its build+layout+paint+raster fully instead of partially, not wait until there is no animations at all. For a CircularProgressIndicator it may take, say, <1ms. The rest 16.66-1=15.66ms will be given to low-priority subtree.

That sounds similar to the "a scrolling ListView" example above in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101227#issuecomment-1247625317. Just as mentioned there (and a little bit similar to https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/106621), we may take a snapshot of the heavy children, when the heavy widgets are rebuilding.

Well, I think there should be a timer for how long the UI is currently built, since you also mentioned `near 16ms`, and the `remaining time`. I think it's easier (and that's what I'm going to try) if I just count the time spent on the framework. But as you say, the problem becomes more complicated when you consider the Raster thread.

@Nayuta403 Clear :)

So seems that it is based on history. Then what if different items have (very) different time needed? That happens frequently IMHO. For example, suppose we have a ListView of posts. Post 1 may be a simple sentence so it is fast. Post 2 may be a long rich text paragraph and complex Paths etc, so it is slow.

Yes, you are absolutely right, because now every task is setState() and only goes back to rendering the real widget on the next frame. One idea I have now is to make this task a real rendering task, similar to marking it as dirty and then executing drawFrame() to get the real time.

I can create an issue later to describe my thinking in detail and make the issue clearer  :>

#### More about "how to build suspendable/interruptable", given that sync generators are slow

Is it possible we create a `RenderSuspendable` RenderObject (and corresponding Suspendable widget) which does the following:

1. Users need to insert this widget into tree whenever they want suspendable. This may be reasonable given this spirit is similar to RepaintBoundary. And users will not need to insert too much, just insert at coarse subtrees. 
2. It behaves like a most naive proxy render box in normal cases.
3. When time is near used up, and when RenderSuspendable.layout is called, it will *not* call child.layout, but instead set a flag (say `needsLayoutLaterWhenPossible`) and directly return. As for the return value, it may return the last layout size or user-defined default size (similar to what keframe does in widget-build level). By doing this, ancestor render objects will be happy and finish its layout function very fast.
4. For a `RenderSuspendable` with `needsLayoutLaterWhenPossible=true`, when a new frame comes in, it will `this.markNeedsLayout()`, and thus get a chance to execute its `layout` method again in this new frame. If time is enough, it is done normally as in "2.", and the needsLayoutLaterWhenPossible is cleared; otherwise, it is done as in "3.".

Remark: May need a tweak a bit about `layout`'s caching mechanism.

Remark: RenderSuspendable's sub-tree will *not* be redundantly layouted more than once. For example, say we have a `Column` with two `Suspendable` children, the first one has done layout, and the second one does not because of timeout. Then, when the next frame comes, Suspendable 2 calls markNeedsLayout, and Column starts performLayout. Then Suspendable 1 *does* have layout() called. However, we should recognize it (possibly flutter caching already does so?), and no need to layout its child at all.

**Features**

* Solves the problem of "how to build suspendable/interruptable", without sync generators
* No need to modify existing render objects, only need to add a new one

**Potential problem**

Unnecessary (i.e. redundant) relayout will happen for ancestors of Suspendable, until meeting a relayout-boundary.

Not sure how large the penalty is. If we can give near enough relayout boundary, looks like it is no problem? In addition, if we wrap *all* expensive subtrees into Suspendables, then the rest may be quite cheap.

**How is layout / paint / rasterize related?**

Done one by one. Layout of *everything* will be firstly finished. Only after that, we start doing painting of everything. And then rasterizing.

**What about paint tree? layer tree? engine(c++) rasterizer?**

TBD, I guess will be similar to above. Looking forward to hearing some feedbacks about the approach for layout first!

#### How can we paint UI onto screen, if we are in half-way of layout/paint/rasterize, and many nodes are dirty / half-way updated?

Basically I have two draft ideas:

Firstly, we may hack the Flutter engine. Let it keep the old content available until the new content is *fully* available.

Secondly, we may be able to solve it without big modifications to engine. We may just "take a screenshot" before starting the journey of heavy updating. For example, suppose we need 10 frames to fully build/layout/paint/rasterize this widget subtree. Then, we use the new `toImageSync()` to take a photo of it. Then, during the 10 frames, we can do anything to the render/layer/engineLayer trees, and whenever the parents let us to paint, we just canvas.drawImage() using that. After 10 frames when we are done, we will finally paint the new thing.

By the way, this also has a bonus about *predictable time consumption*. IMHO, the time of drawing (paint+rasterize+...) a `ui.Image` may be easily computed, given it is nothing but a rasterized image.

---

@dnfield Given that you implemented this great new `toImageSync` feature (https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/33736), I have a question about its performance: 

In the solution above, instead of painting normally, we may have to convert child into `ui.Image` for each and every `paint` call.

In other words, in pseudo code:

```dart
class OurRenderObject {
  void paint() {
    // child.paint(); // cannot do this

    if (everything_is_not_dirty) {
      image = toImageSync(child_render_tree); // save a screenshot
    }

    // ...do some expensive work here if time is sufficient...

    canvas.drawImage(image);
  }
}
```

So, will this have performance penalty or not?

### Progress: 62ms -> 22ms for 99th build time of `list_text_layout`, and its limitations

(Limitations is discussed in the last section of this comment)

The `list_text_layout` is still too fast on my old android, so I enlarged its scale (have more items in column, more text in each item, etc) a little bit. Code is seen in https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter/commit/857210213531e76b3eb5c256a8ef3599ed434703. This yields:

```

  "90th_percentile_frame_build_time_millis": 1.213,

Then, I implement a proof-of-concept Suspendable. Code is at https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter/commit/0babd5b6856bc799c9f369bce75aada7c10fcd0b. Code diff can be found in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/compare/master...fzyzcjy:flutter:feat-smooth?expand=1.

It yields:

```

  "90th_percentile_frame_build_time_millis": 17.769,

---

### Limitations

This is just proof-of-concept and is very naive.

* It only suspends the layout and build phase. (The build phase is wrapped inside layout phase by adding a LayoutBuilder.) Indeed, it does not suspend the paint or raster phase, which should be done in future work.
* It paints nothing (i.e. do not call child.paint) if a Suspendable is suspending. This will destroy the layer tree and C++ engine layer trees, making performance much worse. We should address this problem later, possibly by keeping the layer tree not used but not removed.
* It lets the whole ancestors (up until relayout-boundary) to relayout in each frame.
* Overhead will become non-neglectable, if we want it to run in 60fps. In other words, if we want each frame to be under 16ms, looks like we will only have <10ms for handling the suspendable widgets (rough estimate, but anyway numbers differ on different phones). Then, the price of 60fps smooth animation is that, the suspendable needs longer time to be loaded.
* The current implementation does not run suspendable layouts *last*. Instead, they are run inside non-suspendable layout. Thus, we have to set a "earlier" deadline (e.g. 12ms, instead of 16.6ms in the example above), and hope that the remaining job will finish quick enough.
* [Element.performLayout](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderSliverScrollingPersistentHeader/performLayout.html) says, "In implementing this function, you must call layout on each of your children". But, when implementing Suspendable, we have to violate this. We will face troubles, or just minor changes are enough?
* If a child under Suspendable mark itself as needed to relayout/rebuild, and there is relayout boundary between that child and Suspendable, then the suspending mechanism will not work at all.
* Originally all code (implicitly) assume that, when a frame ends, build/didUpdateWidget has been called. But now this no longer holds. That will make a ton of widget fail to work, including those inside flutter framework, and many external packages. For example, those who assume this inside their addPostFrameCallback.
* The demo does not yet provide any animations (e.g. a CircularProgressIndicator), so by merely looking at the screen, we cannot see it becomes much smoother ;)

### New idea: Dual isolates

(This comment is updated)

#### Advantages

The main goal is similar: No matter how heavy your widget build/layout/... is, animations/gestures should be 60fps.

It does not require existing Flutter/Dart code to accept new assumptions. For example, in the old proposal, the `layout` may *not* be called within a frame, and thus `build` will also not be called. This may violate many existing code. For example, `addPostFrameCallback` may assume build is done when post-frame.

On the contrary, the "Dual isolates" solution will not have those assumptions at all. It seems **not to break existing explicit or implicit assumptions about the code**. Except that it will make Dart isolate "freeze" once in a while - but that should not be a problem, since we are all happy with stop-the-world GC and OS's suspending a thread.

In addition, it should have much lower overhead, indeed almost zero. No wasted build/layout happens (unlike RenderSuspendable approach). No unnecessary tree destory and recreate happens.

#### Background

The approach above, with the minimal sample in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101227#issuecomment-1248894781, has many known problems which I am not sure whether can all be overcome. I will probably also experiment further on that path as well. At the same time, I find out a new approach without most problems above.

I am not an expert in `flutter/engine`, so please correct me if I am wrong!

#### Design

Originally, IMHO we have a UI thread, which runs both C++ code and Dart main isolate code. Now, we have three (but no worries, they will not be parallel most of the time!):

* C++ UI thread.
* Dart main isolate: Run everything you know, i.e. the heavy build/layout/paint/.... Say it takes 2 frames to finish.
* Dart sidecar isolate: Run CircularProgressIndicator, or ShiftTheChild(for scrolling ListView, to be explained below).

An UML diagram is attached below (best read with text explanations here).

Here is what happens when a vsync comes in:

* C++ ui thread receives the vsync. In the old days, it will call dart's DrawFrame. But now, it will set up a timer for a bit less than ~16.67ms (say 15ms), pause self thread, and call Dart main isolate's DrawFrame.
* Dart main isolate's DrawFrame starts running. It runs build/layout happily.
* At 15ms, timer wakes up C++ ui thread. C++ ui thread then immediately "pause" the dart main isolate. This is done by "safepoints". In other words, we insert `safepoint()` call to `layout()` function of Dart RenderObjects. And that function is a native function reading, say, a mutex lock. When C++ ui thread wants to pause the dart main isolate, it simply acquire the mutex. When Dart goes to the next safepoint() call, it will simply be pause there forever waiting to acquire the mutex (until next frame indeed).
* C++ ui thread calls sidecar isolate to compute the whole build/layout/paint procedure. This is done serially now for simplicity, but should be easily parallizable with some locks.
* Sidecar Dart code is a bit different from the traditional widget/renderobject/layers. Instead, it knows which EngineLayer it owns, and only mutates it. For example, for a CircularProgressIndicator in sidecar, it will know it owns a DisplayListLayer, and only modify pictures in it, without touching other layers. For a ShiftTheChild, it owns a OffsetLayer and modifies its offset.
* Now go back to our C++ ui thread. We will simply utilize the current engine layer tree in C++, and the rest is the same, such as giving data to rasterizer thread and render to the screen.

This is not the end of story - notice our main isolate is still computing some layout and is hanging. Now suppose 2nd vsync comes in.

* Again, C++ ui thread receives vsync. It notices there is still remaining job in main isolate. Then it just resume the main isolate, without telling it anything about the second frame. Thus, in the eyes of main isolate, it will think the whole phone just "freezed" for a few milliseconds without other problems, and will happily continue build/layout/etc.
* Suppose the heavy job of the main isolate is finally finished in this frame. Then, it will do painting. In other words, it will mutate the Layer tree in C++ code. We deliberately put no safepoint() during painting, so the C++ layer tree will either be non-mutated or fully-mutated without intermediate case.
* The rest is similar to the first frame, except that our engine layer tree is updated to the new one.

#### Further improvements

* sidecar isolate should be executed concurrently
* main isolate should also be executed concurrently, with locks protecting critical regions such as mutating the engine layer tree. But otherwise, it should run freely. By doing this, we are guaranteed that, we can let main isolate run using almost a full cpu core. On the contrary, the "RenderSuspendable" approach above will only give, say, 10.67ms out of 16.67ms for heavy widget build/layout, because it need (say) 6ms to paint/rasterize existing things.

#### What is `ShiftTheChild`

I want to solve the problem of "ListView scrolling". In other words, when scrolling a ListView, the widget build/layout may be arbitrary heavy, while we should get 60fps.

Thus, let us do the following:

```dart
ParentWidgets(
  child: ShiftTheChild(
    child: ListView.builder( ... )
  )
)
```

Suppose ListView subtree takes 10 frames to rebuild/layout/etc, and suppose the user is scrolling it. Then, during the 10 frames, ShiftTheChild will receive data packets about user dragging and perform a shift (i.e. OffsetLayer's offset) to its child content. ShiftTheChild will be in the sidecar isolate.

P.S. It may not even be a widget or RenderObject, but may be built on some other lower level primitives mutating corresponding C++ engine Layer. But surely we can wrap those primitives and maybe create a RenderSidecar or something new, that should not be a problem.

#### Minimal example

I plan not to implement sidecar isolate in the minimal example. Instead, just create a C++ function that shifts an OffsetLayer in each frame, as if a sidecar isolate is doing so. This is because the sidecar isolate is nontrivial engineering work but is not the core problem.

For this Suspendable render, we may introduce structure like Fiber, I think it is [Threaded tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threaded_binary_tree).

First thing to drawing a frame including heavy/suspendable part is transform tree to a list (or just a threaded tree)

Render task 5 and 6 should and can be suspended at any place in it. (What if a widget/node cost timeout?)

we can tell from figure that suspendable is contagious, content in suspendable cannot be non-suspendable.

Looks interesting, could you please share the link? I have checked your github but seems cannot find anything. (All my Flutter work are done open-source and can be found at my github).

> the key to this is some build/layout callback function/method should not be called in non-main isolate, or just serialize/deseralize build/layout request and response to another isolate like a local RPC service.

Could you please provide an example? Thanks

Btw, my solution does not use non-main isolate with callbacks :) Indeed, I only put CircularProgressIndicator and ShiftTheChild and things like that there. No normal user code should be done in the sidecar isolate, because otherwise it is quite unfriendly to the users (the sidecar isolate has no memory sharing w/ the main isolate).

So I hope it is not a blocker!

> But! Multiple isolates may agains Flutter's principle, I don't sure whether it can be merged.

Could you please elaborate a little bit more?

My solution is still mainly single-isolate, and the sidecar isolate (as mentioned above) is just used very limitedly to support animations.

In addition, my multi-thread is still mostly serialized instead of parallel running. There are multiple threads, simply because I want to suspend/pause one thread easily.

> Dude, you are really high-producing and I'm reading your new comments try to catch up

Haha take your time! It takes me a day thinking and trying all these things :)

Sure, looking forward to that. Btw I also have very complex cases for my own app, but I decide to start from the simple - you know, one of the fundamental rules in software engineering.

> @xanahopper's comment in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101227#issuecomment-1249172293

If I understand correctly, the figure is a bit like a extended version of my prototype https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101227#issuecomment-1248894781 above.

The question is, how are you going to transform a tree to a (suspendable) list - In other words, for example, how to make subtree rooted at 5 become a list that *can be paused*?

I have proposed using `yield` in `performLayout` but @dnfield mentioned it is very slow. Given that your suspendable widgets are contagious, we cannot use yield at all (otherwise we will be using it in a big subtree).

Then in my prototype above I decide to let a Suspendable return zero size when it is near timeout (note: different from your figure, but the problem to solve is similar). But such approach seems not possible for your proposal.

This is solved very easily with my "Dual isolates" proposal. It just call `safepoint()` in every RenderObject's `layout()`. Then, whenever the C++ code wants to suspend Dart, C++ will just let `safepoint()` hang (probably by occupying a mutex). Then Dart code is just hang there, without doing anything, without feeling anything. In Dart code's view it is like a stop-the-world GC indeed.

Multiple isolates and optimize with it is before the specification phase, just for you known that we both have the same idea that I and my colleagues are working on it. for very early part we think that this way may need modify engine or even the Dart VM.

Last time we coming with a issue [#110063](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/110063) and got a refuse with tough attitude.

## Transform

When we need _build_ a Widget, we must already got a widget or state(element), that means we have a _factory_ for children widgets.
All Flutter's build (as long as other declaration UI) is a function call, just like

> UI = f(g(h(state)))

We just change this to 

> ui1 = h(state)
> ui2 = g(ui1)
> UI = f(ui2)

wrap ever build into a node/task and change all that to a chain list. In practice, we can use a deque to collect deeper call.

### Widget tree build:
1. Got a node to build from queue, we dont know whether it will be a leaf node.
2. Execute node's build, add all children to queue.
3. Add executed node to a deque tail.
4. Repeat goto 1

### Element & RO tree build
Because elements generally need children to be ready, so we have to produce it from leaf.
1. Take a node from tail of executed node deque(this will like a stack)
2. Produce Element/RenderObject
3. repeat

It just like traversal a tree without recursion, so we can suspend and resume at any iteration of traversal.
this is a prototype of pseudo code, hope it help.

I see. Willing to collaborate to make it into reality as soon as possible!

I looked at #110063 now. If I understand correctly, seems that @jonahwilliams refuses because "Splitting the UI thread work into multiple theads is infeasible for several reasons", such as "a single thread means that newspace allocations don't need any locking". However, my proposal above deliberately avoids these problem. In my case, the c++ ui thread is sleeping while dart main isolate is running, and (if flutter does not like multi concurrent isolates) the thread and main isolate can also be sleeping while dart sidecar isolate is running. So, we are still running single isolate, and no lock is needed at all!

In short, I am not using multi threading. Instead, all threads are there only to implement suspending.

> or even the Dart VM.

This inspire me of something: If we can implement a suspend mechanism in Dart VM, maybe we do not need that safepoint + one extra thread approach.

Fully understand now :) That should be very workable, just like React Fiber does.

> Element & RO tree build
so we have to produce it from leaf
Produce Element/RenderObject

Sorry I do not get it. We are not going to produce RenderObjects, but (most of the time) *modify* (update) them. For example, say you have a RenderPadding. Then we will only modify its padding field and markNeedsRelayout, instead of throwing away the old padding and create a new one.

Most importantly, how can we get the BoxConstraints (suppose we are dealing with RenderBox)? For example, when we are `layout()` for a leaf, we must know the BoxConstraints its parent wants to give it. But the parent is not yet `layout`ed.

@xanahopper In addition, I have mentioned many limitations of the suspendable tree traversal in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101227#issuecomment-1248894781 (see last section there). Looking forward to see some solutions about it!

For example, a big problem: Originally all code (implicitly) assume that, when a frame ends, build/didUpdateWidget has been called. But now this no longer holds. That will make a ton of widget fail to work, including those inside flutter framework, and many external packages. For example, those who assume this inside their addPostFrameCallback.

**Update**: More problems are added to that comment. For example, "If a child under Suspendable mark itself as needed to relayout/rebuild, and there is relayout boundary between that child and Suspendable, then the suspending mechanism will not work at all."

### Fix UiKitView which wrongly unconditionally repaints

### How the bug is found

This bug is surely not found by human eyes reading each and every line of Flutter code :)

I proposed the idea that a linter can be created (https://github.com/dart-code-checker/dart-code-metrics/issues/997) to validate whether RenderObject field setters have correct early-return code. @incendial implemented it and ran it (https://github.com/dart-code-checker/dart-code-metrics/pull/1003).

Thus, thanks @incendial for implementing the linter and run it through flutter framework code!

### Bug description

As we know, when implementing a setter in RenderObject, we usually early halt if the new value is equal to the old value (such as [this one](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/7fba37848c9f3007795be2d67a3207067b7a0894/packages/flutter/lib/src/rendering/platform_view.dart#L115), indeed almost all fields in RenderObject child classes are examples). This is very necessary, because we are setting fields in `updateRenderObject` *unconditionally*. If we do not early return, we will execute the full logic like markNeedsPaint and so on *unconditionally* on *every* `updateRenderObject`. That will be performance penalty.

The current PR fixes one bug of such case. In more details, the `viewController` field setter lacks such early-return, and thus unconditionally calls markNeedsPaint. The setter is called from `updateRenderObject` as follows:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5236035/190656619-8aae1809-81f7-475e-8786-73b260c6d3b5.png)

And _UiKitPlatformView is used here:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5236035/190656716-04152bb1-d791-4b0a-8b6a-31f72479ae02.png)

In other words, the controller is not changed in every frame. Instead, in common cases, it should be the same one for many frames. However, it triggers repaint for each and every rebuild.

Close #111788

**Update**: I am thinking whether we can remove the need of new threads in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101227#issuecomment-1249005541. If we can pause a Dart isolate without needing new threads, we can remove those threads.

Details can be found in:

* https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/49981

---

**Update**: I am trying to use the spirit of stackful coroutines to implement it.

I do get stuck. We have a ton of callbacks from C++ calling into Dart, such as when the image data has been loaded successfully. If the dart main isolate is freezed (either by stackful coroutine, or by a normal thread with mutex), C++ code cannot call Dart at all. Delaying those calls also seem very troublesome because of resource deallocation problems.

### Rethinking (overcoming) the shortcomings of [the `Suspendable` "62ms->22ms" experiment](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101227#issuecomment-1248894781)

The quoted text are the shortcomings mentioned in the experiment, and black text are my re-thoughts.

> It only suspends the layout and build phase. (The build phase is wrapped inside layout phase by adding a LayoutBuilder.) Indeed, it does not suspend the paint or raster phase, which should be done in future work.

Given the [discord discussions](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101227#issuecomment-1249961627) among @Hixie and @dnfield etc, seems build/layout is mostly the expensive one. So paint or raster may not needed to be considered at the highest priority, at least not implemented in this issue and may defer to future work.

> It paints nothing (i.e. do not call child.paint) if a Suspendable is suspending. This will destroy the layer tree and C++ engine layer trees, making performance much worse. We should address this problem later, possibly by keeping the layer tree not used but not removed.

This is not a problem if we only consider the jank caused by widget creation/deletion (like going to a new page or ListView scroll to make a new widget visible).

> It lets the whole ancestors (up until relayout-boundary) to relayout in each frame.

But I guess this should not be a big problem in real world, because we should keep the heavy things in Suspendable subtrees and keep the ancestors simple.

> Overhead will become non-neglectable, if we want it to run in 60fps. In other words, if we want each frame to be under 16ms, looks like we will only have <10ms for handling the suspendable widgets (rough estimate, but anyway numbers differ on different phones). Then, the price of 60fps smooth animation is that, the suspendable needs longer time to be loaded.

However, if we want to keep it single-threaded (single isolate), as #110063 (multi isolate) is refused, this is the price we have to pay.

> If a child under Suspendable mark itself as needed to relayout/rebuild, and there is relayout boundary between that child and Suspendable, then the suspending mechanism will not work at all.

We should add more Suspendables if we observe such situation. More specifically, we should add a Suspendable (or, if using `keframe`-like solution, the FrameSeparateWidget) near that specific widget. Then, this is no longer a problem.

p.s. This is not a problem if we only consider the jank caused by widget creation/deletion (like going to a new page or ListView scroll to make a new widget visible).

> The current implementation does not run suspendable layouts *last*. Instead, they are run inside non-suspendable layout. Thus, we have to set a "earlier" deadline (e.g. 12ms, instead of 16.6ms in the example above), and hope that the remaining job will finish quick enough.

Not a critical problem indeed.

> [Element.performLayout](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderSliverScrollingPersistentHeader/performLayout.html) says, "In implementing this function, you must call layout on each of your children". But, when implementing Suspendable, we have to violate this. We will face troubles, or just minor changes are enough?

Will see whether it is a problem after doing more experiments.

> Originally all code (implicitly) assume that, when a frame ends, build/didUpdateWidget has been called. But now this no longer holds. That will make a ton of widget fail to work, including those inside flutter framework, and many external packages. For example, those who assume this inside their addPostFrameCallback.

Since this feature is completely opt-in (you have to manually put the Suspendable widget into your tree), users may be able to migrate their widgets when they decide to use Suspendable.

The problem is, it may take efforts to migrate each and every widget, and it also takes time to migrate all inside flutter framework itself. Luckily, it is opt-in, so we can do it steadily and slowly, just like how we migrate to `Material 3` theme (it has been months but still not finished).

Many code may migrate smoothly without any problem. (For example, I personally used MobX for my Flutter app, which has reactive states and automatic rebuild, so I seldom touch the raw frame callbacks. For many widgets in flutter framework we can reason about it in our heads and they seem ok as well.)

We may need to provide some information to the users, indeed `State`s or `BulidContext`s, telling them they have been suspended. A simple method may be adding a field to `State/BuildContext`, or use a `InheritedWidget`. I may defer this work after seeing what info a real widget wants when migrating real widgets.

### Enhance `keframe`: Now seems it can build/layout as many items as possible until time is up, i.e. have strategy similar to the ["layout" proposal](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101227#issuecomment-1248894781) above

@Nayuta403 

#### The problem

As is discussed in https://github.com/LianjiaTech/keframe/issues/12#issuecomment-1238873216 and (IIRC) earlier comments, `keframe` now blindly builds one widget per frame, even if it can build (for example) 5 widgets. This makes the UI need much longer time to display fully. In addition, it always lag by one frame, because it uses setState in a addPostFrameCallback to update its widget.

#### The solution

IMHO, the following suggestion can avoid the problems above. Now it can build/layout as many items as possible until time is up, i.e. have strategy similar to the "layout" proposal above. Please correct me if I am wrong!

As can be seen in the code example below, the key point is a `LayoutBuilder` wrapped as parent of `FrameSeparateWidget`. By doing so, we ensure that the build *and layout* phase of widgets prior to the current widget has already been done. Now, FrameSeparateWidget can do a simple decision in its `build` method - if time is sufficient just return new child, otherwise return the old one and rebuild in the next frame.

By the way, this is partially equivalent to the "layout" proposal because of the following: IMHO, the `builder` callback inside a `LayoutBuilder` is called within `performLayout`. Therefore, the `build` of the child widget is strongly related to the `layout` of the LayoutBuilder render object. Then, I can partially migrate the idea in the "layout" proposal (where I hacked the performLayout) to this case (where I hack the build).

#### Full code example and output

The dummy `timeRemain` simulates the real world where we may have (e.g.) 16ms for each frame.

@Nayuta403 If you are interested, I can try to make it a full library. Given that it is based on keframe's idea (hack widget build), but at the same time it is quite different from the existing implementation (do not use addPostFrameCallback and use the LayoutBuilder hack), I am not sure whether I should make a PR to keframe, or I should create a separate lib by myself (and mention keframe)?

@fzyzcjy  Hi man, you are very thoughtful and full of passion, thank you for your thoughts. Recently I have been busy with work.I want to first communicate with you about Keframe idea and then follow up your discussion.

>As can be seen in the code example below, the key point is a LayoutBuilder wrapped as parent of FrameSeparateWidget.  By doing so, we ensure that the build and layout phase of widgets prior to the current widget has already been done.

👍 👍   Your idea is great, we can hit the timer at the beginning of a frame and it seems to calculate the `timeRemian`. If you don't mind, I think you can create a branch/PR in KeFrame for discussion (I've given you a Write access) because there's some basic mechanics in there and a ready-made example in there.

> In addition, it always lag by one frame, because it uses setState in a addPostFrameCallback to update its widget.

I think this will not happen, because KeFrame calls `addPostTimeCallBack` during initState (i.e.https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/5816d20b86b95205c40921fa91ee3434b9c97ac6/packages/flutter/lib/src/scheduler/binding.dart#L1197-L1201) and _postFrameCallbacks call after `_persistentCallbacks` is finished (i.e.
https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/5816d20b86b95205c40921fa91ee3434b9c97ac6/packages/flutter/lib/src/scheduler/binding.dart#L1203-L1210), They're both in the `handleDrawFrame` method, so I think they're still in the same frame.

Ps: I actually think Fiber and Keframe will end up with similar results, but Keframe will work within the existing framework and won't require a lot of changes to the framework and engine. I think we can contribute it to the flutter after we've optimized it, like nested in a ListView or a Column or something, and open it with flags, like a RepaintBoundary.

@Nayuta403 You are welcome!

> we can hit the timer at the beginning of a frame and it seems to calculate the timeRemian

Yes, just like my "layout" demo, which I recorded when the frame begins.

> In addition, it always lag by one frame, ... I think this will not happen

Well yes the function call is in the same frame; but indeed, if I understand correctly, the *build* will lag one frame. Consider the simplest example, where we are building a new widget tree (thus initState) with a child. Then, in frame 1, FrameSeparateWidget has initState and build called. But it is only at the post-frame callback phase that FrameSeparateWidget.result is filled with the real child. So it is only at frame 2 that FrameSeparateWidget really renders the child onto the screen.

That looks interesting, and I love to contribute to Flutter :) But I am worried whether Flutter will accept such widgets that can live in thirdparty packages. On the contrary, if we need to modify the framework and it has to be integrated with the framework, then surely we need to put it into flutter framework.

> create a branch/PR in KeFrame for discussion (I've given you a Write access) 

Thanks for your invitation (I see it). However, I realize keframe is under `LianJia`, a commercial company. It is not a person (e.g. you), a nonprofit organization (e.g. the flutter organization, the llvm org, the mobx org), a company known to have a ton of open source contributions (e.g. google), or something like that. So I am very sorry I cannot join it. But anyway, all my work will be open-sourced, and under license like MIT, so everyone can use it!

@Nayuta403 A bit more explanation: Why we do not need to worry about "the child subtree build&layout for a FrameSeparateWidget is so long that it makes everything slow"?

Because if that is the case, we can wrap several FrameSeparateWidget in the heavy parts of that subtree. Then, because each (new version I proposed yesterday) FrameSeparateWidget builds normally if not timeout, it will behave normally if time is ok; on the contrary, as long as time is up, subtree will pause to build. By doing this, we can ensure every FrameSeparateWidget takes moderate time length (say, 1ms), and there is no such case as one FrameSeparateWidget taking (e.g.) 100ms so everything is jank.

Yes, I was negligent. `Lianjia` is the company I used to work for. Just because this project is completed by me and has a certain number of users, I am still maintaining it personally. You are absolutely right, I also wish we had some open-sourced work available to everyone.  We can work on your project https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_smooth

> A bit more explanation: Why we do not need to worry about "the child subtree build&layout for a FrameSeparateWidget is so long that it makes everything slow"?

Yes, I can understand that. For the subtree to time out, we can delay the build again by nesting the FrameSeparateWidget, which I've used before. I think from this point of view, all widget builds are interruptible, this Fiber-like mechanism.  I have a crazy idea that if we add a `placholder` property to all widget(Not all, we can add this property to some base class), we will build the `placholder` if the frame `timeRemain` time is 0. Then the jank will never happen ! HHHHH

> Update: Some experiments here using the new implementation.

I like your new implementation, which seems to have solved the problem we mentioned earlier by laying out as many widgets as possible in each frame. I think there may be some details that need to be added ：
* Whether other lifecycle states should be considered for `_SmoothState`, such as `didUpdateWidget` or `onDispose`. For example, I encountered an error in keframe when setState was called from outside because `result` was cached in State. If the `widget.child` is changed externally so that it does not work (It doesn't look like it's going to happen because you're using widget.child directly in build, but I think you might need to think about it when using State, I can add a https://github.com/LianjiaTech/keframe/blob/master/example/lib/page/complex_list_example.dart in your example)
* In your example, the height of the item is 24. But for the list, many times we don't know the width and height at code time, and jitter will occur when the placeholder and the actual list are not the same width and height.(because placeholder becomes item, Causing sibling layout changes). like this [example](https://github.com/LianjiaTech/keframe/blob/master/example/lib/page/opt/list_opt_example2.dart) in keframe. I did this by using `SizeCacheWidget` to cache the width and height of the item and force it to the placeholder so that it would not shake the second time the item was displayed. (You can't avoid it the first time, because the Item doesn't have a layout.) Do you have any other ideas?


> On the contrary, if we need to modify the framework and it has to be integrated with the framework, then surely we need to put it into flutter framework.

Yes, I think if we do it well enough, we can communicate with the Flutter Team and submit it to the Flutter Framework.  I communicated with @dnfield  a long time ago and he was also interested in it. [discord](https://discord.com/channels/608014603317936148/613398126367211520/977268943238602782)
 If we want to commit to Flutter Framework , what is the value of `kTimeThreshold`? Since we are only counting the build/layout time now, using 16.7 doesn't seem particularly appropriate, and for 120HZ devices, this value should be 16.7/2 ms

How do you think about it?

Agree! At least we should add a test in our code, asserting its correctness

I think that is a pretty smart idea, and has not found other solutions yet. If you approve I will add things similar to that into the codebase. The idea will be the same, while implementation will differ slightly (e.g. use a InheritedWidget + StatefulWidget + controller).

Totally agree. (Btw I have searched through the history a few days ago: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101227#issuecomment-1249961627)

The 120hz should be simple since we can detect what frequency we are under.

The problem is "we are only counting the build/layout time now". 

Btw, I realized that, for a scrolling list, the "finalizing" phase also takes time. Let alone the paint/compositing phase we all have known.

They (paint/compositing/finalizing) each take a little of time, but when accumulated, it is non-neglectible for that 16ms.

Btw, recent ideas:

* I am considering halting the `paint` phase as well: Maybe we can directly reuse the old Layer, so we can get the same UI and at the same time do not call paint on subtree. This is just very naive idea and I will make an experiment later.
* "for a scrolling list, the "finalizing" phase also takes time" - Maybe we can hack ListView itself, and control when it disposes its widgets.

### New idea: Preemption

#### Advantages

It can nearly achieve my goal: 60fps, no matter how heavy your build/layout are. Without limitations of other approaches, such as the ones in flutter_smooth, or the ones in "layout" proposal where the widget subtree has to allow their build/layout not called in some frames.

It also *has zero overhead about re-layouting*, i.e. it will *never* need to pay any extra cost to layout, compared to the widget/layout based approaches. It also solves the problem of "how to suspend a layout". I can explain more advantages and comparisons if needed.

Compared with the "dual isolate" proposal above, that one seems very hard to implement as it requires threads or coroutines, but this proposal is not. In addition, this proposal eliminate the second "sidecar" isolate, and everything is in main isolate, so we can run any code with all data in main isolate memory visible.

#### Details

Continue and modified from https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101227#issuecomment-1249005541 (the "dual isolates" idea, but without the need of adding new threads (very troublesome to do syncing), or c++ coroutines (troublesome when c++ wants to call dart callback).

Notice that, the c++ code, main isolate, and sidecar isolate all run on "ui thread". No new threads, no coroutines, etc. So this time, the diagram draws nothing but very normal function calls.

Description of the figure:

* vsync comes.
* As normal, C++ calls Dart's drawFrame.
* Suppose Dart has 3 widgets to build/layout. It build/layout the 1st, then 2nd.
* Then it realizes time has up (say, 15ms has come), when `layout()` the 2nd widget. Then it calls `preemptRaster()` (a dart function).
* In `preemptRaster`, we firstly call `preemptModifyLayerTree` to modify the layer tree a bit, like CircularProgressIndicator or the scrolling ListView wrapper widget case, described in "dual isolate" proposal above. For simplicity, imagine this `preemptModifyLayerTree` is implemented via very low level API, such as `containerLayer.offset = Offset(10,20)`.
* In `preemptRaster`, we then call a probably modified version of FlutterView.render. In other words, we provide layer tree to C++ code, and c++ code provide it to raster thread. *Notice what layer tree we provide here*: Because `preemptRaster` is called within a `layout()`, the `paint` phase has not started, so the layer tree is completely old (instead of mixed). ThusIn addition, `preemptModifyLayerTree` will modify the layer tree a bit. That's all. We will send this to raster.
* Raster thread renders that layer tree as usual, so we see beautiful things on screen. 
* UI thread C++/Dart goes on, because `preemptRaster` function returns. The Dart code will continue from where `preemptRaster` is called (you know, just very plain function calls; but this solves the "how to suspend a layout call" implicitly indeed). In Dart's view, it thinks it is still the 1st frame. Let's say it continues layouting the 2nd widget. Then 3rd widget. Then paint, flush compositing bits, semantics, etc.
* Then finally, as a normal pipeline stage, dart provides the new layer tree and let c++ to throw it to the raster thread.
* Raster thread renders it to screen in the background.
* Then, just like what will be done normally in frame 1, call post frame callbacks, c++ calls dart for some callbacks, etc.
* Now ui thread is idle. When next vsync comes, the same loop will go.

Yeah, I think the code willn't be much different, or I can directly PR to your repo? This jitter usually occurs in ListView, which needs to be nested with SizeCacheWidget in KeFrame, and LayoutInfoNotification is emitted in FrameSpeWidget. So the user has to specify SizeCacheWidget if they want to user ListView.  if it's in Flutter framework, we can add it directly, or do you have other ideas?

Yes, we can get it directly from the engine, but I have to see how to get it in the framework. It may be necessary to add an API

Yes, I think we can ignore this factor for now as I understand it is not particularly time consuming. Or we can directly change the "finalizing" timing of the ListView.



> I am considering halting the paint phase as well: Maybe we can directly reuse the old Layer, so we can get the same UI and at the same time do not call paint on subtree. This is just very naive idea and I will make an experiment later.

I agree with that, I think you just need to nest `RepaintBoundary` on the subtree, right? Just like ListView item, avoid subtree paint causing pain in other widgets.

Sure! But I am hesitate whether going on flutter_smooth now, as the "preemption" proposal seems quite appealing and addresses many problems of flutter_smooth, the layout proposal, and the keframe.

Could you please have a look at "preemption" proposal :) I want to implement a prototype tomorrow (UTC+8 timezone).

That LGTM. Indeed I will do something like: The `SizeCacheWidget` (I may call it `SmoothParent`) has some inherited widget to provide a controller to its child subtree. Then child can save anything they want to that controller. Anyway, those are simple things, and I can also do it if you like (just need e.g. 15 minutes).

> Yes, we can get it directly from the engine, but I have to see how to get it in the framework. It may be necessary to add an API

I remembered I did that via calling java/swift. Anyway this is minor problem :)

Yes, but I hope not too many RepaintBoundary in the meanwhile. IIRC during some testing they add overheads. Btw the "preemption" proposal does not have this problem.

Let's say, for simplicity as a demo, just modify a layer directly via lowest level api. - But we can definitely wrap it to some higher level. And with future thinking maybe we can also do something with existing widget framework.

I wonder how this Frame1 is generated, now there are only two widgets with build/layout and neither of them have paint/comp etc. If you use the LayerTree from the previous frame that It looks the same as it does now. (A jank happened)

A question: Take `RenderOpacity` for example, and suppose we want that in preemptRaster. Currently it is: 
```
layer = context.pushOpacity(offset, _alpha, super.paint, oldLayer: layer as OpacityLayer?);

// definition
  OpacityLayer pushOpacity(Offset offset, int alpha, PaintingContextCallback painter, { OpacityLayer? oldLayer }) {
    final OpacityLayer layer = oldLayer ?? OpacityLayer();
    layer
      ..alpha = alpha
      ..offset = offset;
    pushLayer(layer, painter, Offset.zero);
    return layer;
  }
```
So, my naive thought of directly manipulating it:
```
void directlyManipulateOpacityInPreemptRaster() {
  final OpacityLayer layer = layer_tree.children.where(...); // find opacity layer
  layer.alpha = some_new_value_for_animation;
}
```
If I call merely this, without all those PictureRecorder/create-new-layer etc, will it be acceptable?

Well I should say, this diagram happens *after* we have rendered a lot of frames. So the layer tree is already there, just *without* the several newly added/modified widgets.

> If you use the LayerTree from the previous frame that It looks the same as it does now. (A jank happened)
Am I getting it wrong?

No, I call `preemptModifyLayerTree`. That one handles animations, e.g. CircularProgressIndicator, or ListView scrolling, or opacity changing animation. For simplest example, for opacity, it may update a OpacityLayer.opacity from 0.1 to 0.2 etc.

Just sharing some experience I've had working on performance: it's very rare to find that applications are blocked on the UI thread, except for 1) incorrectly implemented scrolling 2) lack of isolate usage for data processing. Thus I would be quite skeptical that this sort of change would actually be beneficial to most Flutter developers, and design doc or not there is almost no chance I would be in favor of adding this to the framework.

@dnfield pointed out another case to me, which is that on particularly low end android devices, even simple UIs can jank due to text layout costs. Though I think its also fairly common for these particularly low end devices to have very few cores, or only one or two fast cores - meaning that multithreading may not help much either.

I think the only thing that would cause me to change my mind is a prototype that demonstrated substantially better performance on a real-ish app; that is one that did not intentionally do way too much work.

Not trying to be too discouraging, but I want to make sure that we're on the same page on the expectations for a feature like this.

I understand that this technique has been successful for bytedance and others, I'm not disputing or disagreeing with this. But adding something to the SDK, especially if it is a large intrusive change, is going to be held to the standard of whether it will be successful for all or most users of Flutter today. To evaluate this, we'll need _at least_ a design doc, so we can understand the change you're trying to make. Ideally we would also have some sort of prototype, so that we can understand the behavioral changes, if any, required.

If we can stop rendering at any point, how do we resolve the sizes of render objects that depend on their children?

What about something like a layout builder? If we pre-empted layout then we may not actually be able to finish building?

If we stop rendering based on time elapsed at an arbitrary RO, there is a risk we end up with a UI that makes no sense. i.e. we could get buttons with no labels or half filled in text. I'd be concerned that without a developer making an intentional choice of where to stop rendering, we'd be worse off than if we janked and took longer to render

We do not resolve sizes. Indeed, we are using the _previous fully_ rendered UI (plus modifications in preemptModifyLayer).

The flutter test framework generally allows developers to elapsed arbitrary amounts of time with fake async usage. This is intentional to ensure that unit tests can be reasonably deterministic.

It would be massively breaking for unit tests to take a different number of frames to reach the same conclusion, depending on the speed of the host hardware.

Indeed, imagine the whole proposal like this: We are still running the janky slow UI that is less than 60FPS. But, once in a while, we "secretly" flush old layer tree + some preemptModifyLayer modifications to the screen.

It seems like that would only work if the previous UI was quite similar to the current UI, but that may not be the case.

How do you connect the current render object with the previous UI? The ROs are stateful objects, the only stable representation may be the old layer tree.

We should fake the meaning of "time" in this proposal as well. For example, we may provide a variable called `preemptStrategy`:

```
abstract class PreemptStrategy {
bool shouldWePreemptNow();
} 
```

and call it in place of "checking whether 15 ms has passed".

Then, when testing, we are in full control. For example, we can disable the whole preempt. We can decide to preempt at a specific RenderObject we like to test. etc

Seems reasonable. FWIW, the amount of time available will vary per platform, and in the case of devices with dynamic refresh rates it may even vary frame to frame. I believe we should know the approximate target time for each frame when it starts though

I am mainly thinking about janks in animations. The examples - progress indicator, scrolling listview, enter page transition, all are examples.

If your previous UI does not look similar to current, it is also OK. My proposal is just like, "originally the UI is janky, now we add some extra frames into its normal frames".

Anyway they can always disable it by a simple flag in widgets.

When flushing ui during animation, we just provide (old + minor modified) layer tree. We do not touch RO indeed.

What I mean is - how do you detect that the previous UI is not like the current UI? Its OK if this isn't a performance improvement for that case, but I don't see how you would actually determine that it was "Safe" to use an old layer tree

It is always safe. Because we are just "inserting" extra frames into the plain old frames!

For example, suppose it originally runs at 10 fps. Now, between frame 1 and frame 2, we insert frame 1a,1b,1c, ..., which is very alike frame 1 except for minor modifications (such as one OffsetLayer.offset).

If the users find this UI weird in their special case, they can also choose to disable surely.

Thanks @fzyzcjy , I left some comments in the doc which I see you've responded to. In general, my feedback is that I don't see how some parts of your proposal would actually work in practice. Re-using the previous frame and yielding during layout may break many fundamental assumptions we've made throughout the framework, and without a runnable example/prototype I don't think we're going to be able to understand the trade-offs you're making.

I'd also add that I don't think you need new engine APIS for this.

That is a very substantial change. What is the advantage to that approach over scheduling a new frame after the preemption?

Sorry not quite get it. If we schedule a new frame, and vsync comes, what should we do? We cannot call Flutter's onDrawFrame definitely, because Flutter is still busy doing build/layout/... of the first frame.

So backing up a bit, you're not really pre-empting in the way I thought you were. My idea was something like:

* Start drawing a frame
* Exceed threshold
* Submit frame
* Schedule new frame with some metadata that allows continuation.
* Repeat

Then your idea is more like:

* Start drawing a frame
* Exceed threshold
* Submit frame
* Continue building
* Submit frame
* Finish building

Is that correct?

"with some metadata that allows continuation" - that seems to be the approach that was discussed in Jan 2022 by @Hixie etc, and discussed again in May (?) 2022 by bytedance people, and discussed again by me in github.

one disadvantage of not yielding is that I don't think you'll receive input events. i.e. you start a page transition, start janking and then the user cancels. How do you avoid just continuing the animation?

At least if you yield, you could receive input events and run event handlers

It is just for simple things like "shifting a listview". For normal gestures, let it be done in normal frame pipeline. In other words, suppose it takes 1s to run a full pipeline, then the ListView will see all touch events during this 1s.

It depends on what your goal is. If you want to keep exploring this, I don't see any way forward besides building a prototype. I may yet be wrong, or we may learn something from the proposal even if it doesn't get accepted.

@Jonah Williams About the event handler problem: In React Fiber example, a programmer has to think about two systems as well - the JS animation system and CSS animation system. They have to think about "the JS animation is jank while CSS animation runs smoothly" and collaborate with that. So in our Flutter even handler problem, maybe it is OK for dev to think about "the ListView  event handler is janky, while the preempt scrolling is smooth"?

Let the dev do the job. For example, suppose we are developing this Discord mobile app. Then I will specify "it is always visible" if I am the dev.

the problem with opt in, is that most folks won't. Similarly, I don't think creating a parallel event handling system is reasonable.

@Jonah Williams Another workaround: What if we throw away support for gesture system in preemptRender?
When scrolling a ListView, it is mainly the inertia the drives the list to move, and seems that human finger speed will not dramatically change during a swipe. Then, if we never support gesture in preemptRender, the following will happen: (1) ListView is scrolled at 60fps, instead of (e.g.) 15fps, so user eyes will not see jank. (2) ListView is responding to user finger at only 15fps, but since this is not a game but just a scrolling, users may not feel it

I looked at the document, an interesting idea for sure with the synchronous/parallel tree. But I also think it won't be feasible to implement the preemptModifyLayerTree() unless the animation is very simple. The more applicable it is, the more you are just reimplementing the framework.

It already supports the following with simple code, see doc for details:
* any widgets fit within DisplayListLayer, such as CircularProgressIndicator. Arbitrarily fancy animation goes here, as long as in one DisplayListLayer. Or more generally, if they fit in a leaf subtree.
* let ListView scroll at 60fps

@Callum We may integrate with the existing framework and allow a lot of widgets to animate (just a very rough proposal): Indeed what is done in preemptModifyLayerTree is just to modify arbitrary layers, so maybe we can reuse existing framework to arbitrarily render a subtree etc. Not come up with details yet though.
But anyway, I guess most people just need a smooth loading indicator, a smooth scrolling listview?

If we put wrong number of grey blocks, the UI will be of wrong height. Then, after it gets the real height, all widgets below it (suppose we have a ListView) will jump

@Jonah Williams Well, what about this: It is still the plain old Flutter with (e.g.) 15fps. But we just have some "magic" here, such that it automatically generates something as a "tween" to have 60fps.

IIRC, some researches or nvidia has some "magic" such that, they input some low resolution low fps frames, and output high resolution high fps frames
Consider this proposal as such kind of "tween creator", then maybe dev will feel it natural

This is a good part of what makes it hard. The difficult case right now isn't the progress indicator, it's when you have a large scene change (like a route transition or some other full screen animation).

And lets say you want to render a lot of small pieces of text, which now all have to get laid out for the first time and will send you over budget for a single frame.

Layout for a single widget can easily blow through frame budget. That's part of what we'd like to solve with an interruptible approach, assuming such an approach is possible.

These are not particularly pressing examples right now - showing a single progress indicator or simple animation tends not to be the issue, it's more like doing a full screen route transition where you're building a a large new tree or subtree with a few hundred widgets to inflate and layout.

Hmm do you mean one single _leaf_ widget? 

Indeed that is also very simple: I am proposing adding `if (timeout) preemptRender()` at the beginning of each RenderObject.layout.

Now, we can add more. Say, for YourHeavyRenderObject.performLayout() function, add 10 of such `if timeout preemptRender`

Well the example is indeed, "have progress indicator 60fps, *while* we are doing something really heavy". i.e. just the interesting case you said :)

The proposal do not interrupt, neither restart. It just calls a function (the preemptRender).

If I understand correctly, you want to use the full LayerTree result from the last time. Like this object in the Raster thread?

In the current Framework design, once entering the RenderFlexObject, all child nodes will be Layout, and when the RO tree Layout is completed, paint will be submitted. Now we add a timer to the RenderFlexObject layout, the first child node layout is almost finished (16ms), at which point we interrupt the layout and submit the current RO tree for Paint. At this point, RenderFlexObject contains a child node. When the next schedule comes, do I continue to start from this RenderFlexObject node or something else?

So I guess you mean your example has an app which has Flex as its root widget, and thus RenderFlex as its root RenderObject?

We do not continue to "start from" anywhere. We just *call* the preemptRender function inside `RenderObject.layout()`. And then, when preemptRender function returns, we continue running our code.

There are two issues I would love to see more detail on: 
1. How to generate this Layertree to the Engine when an interrupt occurs (e.g., two frames are completely different) 
2. How to handle vsync scheduling in case of interruption (for example, the whole Widget tree changes in the next vsync)

Since when preemptRender happens, we are in build & layout phase, we never touch layer tree yet. So we have the old layer tree. Now, we provide the old layer tree (with minor modify from preemptModifyLayerTree), to the engine

No vsync is passed to dart layer during jank. Say we have a build/layout that takes 1s. Then during the 60 hardware vsync, we render 60 frames to screen via preemptRender. However, for the Dart code (excluding the preemptRender part), it only sees *one* vsync, *one* build/paint/layout/etc.

I think the core is the design of this `preemptModifyLayerTree` which sounds similar to some low FPS conversion high FPS (inserting excessive frames in the middle).

Yes and no. 
1. For whatever widget tree that fit in a layer subtree without disturbing others, like a CircularProgressIndicator, reuse existing (well, to-be-written) PreemptDisplayList
2. For listview scrolling, maybe just let ListView's RO implement preemptModifyLayerTree to implement inertia etc. (The design doc is a bit old, see discussions above for details)
3. But I will think about more general solution to support arbitrary case. Anyway this is not the top priority - we should have the main idea running

A question popped into my mind, I'm thinking of what the difference between this and Keframe(Especially after your optimization, build/layout as many widgets as possible in one frame)? For example, for some Wigdet you mentioned, need to implement preemptModifyLayerTree, and in this case, what if you use KeFrame and you set a placeholder like that?

@fzyzcjy Hey! I've been lurking on the GitHub thread and didn't want to ask this there as I feel like I'm missing something.

Does your most recent proposal allow trivial layout changes to take priority over multi-frame changes? It seems a lot of nontrivial animations require some amount of layout shifting, but your diagram seems to indicate that all widgets must still build and layout in turn, so if an expensive widget needed to rebuild in a different part of the tree then it would still jank since the animation builder would still need to wait its turn.

Sorry if this is somewhat ignorant, I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it all.

@Jonah Williams Continuing from the problem of gesture subsystem of the design, here is a mental modal:

Some researchers/nvidia/etc have some "magic" such that, they can input some low resolution low fps frames, and output high resolution high fps frames. Consider this proposal as such a kind of "tween creator". In other words, originally we have janky rendering (say, 15fps). And now, we add three extra animating frames after each of the 15fps frames, to get a 60fps smooth feeling.

It works well, no need to do any special treatment indeed 🙂

yes, allow things like a animating indicator or a scrolling listview to take priority over normal janky heavy build/layout

But will that be common? "some amount of layout shifting" - For example, a scrolling listview is very common case where we need 60fps smoothness. See the design doc, it indeed only needs a tiny change to OffsetLayer.offset

A couple of months ago I looked into build/layout performance.  I tried to squeeze as much as I could out of the framework but ran out of ideas.  My understanding from looking into is a lot of jank was shader compilation.  The thing that might be holding back layout / build is locality which will be hard to fix.

the way flutter does build and layout is interleaved, but not fine-grained. lots of building happens, then lots of layout, then lots of building, etc. You can run out of time at any time in this process, with a hundred widgets built but not laid out, for example. now the system is in a very inconsistent state.

Thanks I will add a section to design doc. 
"shader compilation" - seems that @Jsouliang has mentioned above, they expect Impeller to solve the problem. Personally speaking I am not very sure b/c have not checked into impeller deeply.
"might be holding back layout / build is locality" - could you please elaborate it a bit - Do you mean memory locality that causes page fault etc? Anyway, *any form* of build/layout slowness can be fixed by this proposal, no matter the cause. Even if you just heavily compute synchronously inside initState, this proposal can also fix 🙂
"I guess my point is that if you want to propose a solution that fixes long (build + layout) times, we should establish that that is a worthwhile problem to fix backed up with some data." - I agree. I wonder whether this is enough: @dnfield has gived a pointer, "A good canonical case here would be something like https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/dev/benchmarks/macrobenchmarks/lib/src/list_text_layout.dart. This ends up being janky because layout gets expensive for all that text (on a lower end phone it can easily take 20-30+ms just to layout all the text there, and the ListTile is a little deceptive because Material introduces expense - this is the kind of thing we want to figure out how to break up "automatically")."

Oh interesting, I hadn't seen the list text layout benchmark.  WRT heavily computing inside initState shouldn't happen on the isolate, we should be giving users the tools to quickly offload work to a background isolate.  I think flutter/dart can do better there.  With the locality, yea talking about memory locality.  When I ran profiles I saw numbers that couldn't be associated with a single widget.  I suspect it is the recursive nature of crawling down the widget / render trees which jumps all over in memory.  Also Dart doesn't have value types so every single rectangle in layout is an indirection to another location in memory.  The locality thing is my pet theory, I can't prove it though 😛

also @fzyzcjy you should look into impeller, i haven't run it recently and I don't want to hype it much, but it should make a huge impact.  it's almost not worth looking into jank until after it.  you can turn it on with a flag.

> WRT heavily computing inside initState shouldn't happen on the isolate, we should be giving users the tools to quickly offload work to a background isolate.
Sure, that should be a misuse in most of the time 🙂
But indeed, sometimes it is sane to do so. For a simple example, you may have a giant tree in main isolate, and have to modify a lot of its nodes. It is hard (or impossible) to send it to another isolate, modify, and go back, otherwise copying is either too slow or even impossible for some types of objects. Anyway that is just a side remark, and my proposal is not designed to solely solve this special case

Last frame,  but plus "preemptModifyLayerTree". For the scrolling listview example, we will modify the OffsetLayer.offset a bit (the amount by inertia). Then, users will see the list content shifted a little bit. So users will see list scrolling smoothly at 60fps, even if one build/layout/paint/... cycle takes, say, 10fps.

> It is hard (or impossible) to send it to another isolate, modify, and go back, 
Yea a couple months ago I tried to come up with a way to get move semantics for sending data between isolates in constant time.  I couldn't find a good proposal that the dart team liked.

No problem :) Progress indicator updates the UI also inside preemptModifyLayerTree, and that is why it is smooth 60fps.

Yea, sorta, but if you are blocking the platform thread you can be blocking events which feels janky.  it really depends on the embedder too what effect it can have.  I'm not saying build/layout isn't a potential issue, but from my having looked into this a couple months ago I think shader compilation was by and far the biggest issue which is good the flutter team is making a big investment there

Users manually write down "PreemptDisplayList(child:CircularProgressIndicator(preempt: false, … other argos …),)"

Then, when framework wants to preempt render an extra frame, it calls PreemptDisplayList.preemptModifyLayerTree.

If the animation is really the slow part under that special case, then any single-threaded solution will not work IMHO. (Seems flutter does not want multithread and I agree with that, so we only consider single thread solutions)

@dnfield  Yes, if I understand correctly, this case should not need to be considered separately. Since this solution does not affect the existing flow, it just calls preemptRender to submit a frame of drawing to engine at the end of the 16ms. Then continue back to the existing Layout flow

@fzyzcjy  Yeah, I thought about it later, and I think one of the challenges is. In the case of video, when we go from 15FPS to 30fps, we actually know the content of each frame, so we can calculate the difference between two frames and interpolate them (IIRC some frames are diff messages). But with Flutter, we don't know what it looks like until we paint it on the next frame.

For the navigation, say the new page takes 3 frame to render and the page shift animation is 10 frame. Then, users will see 60fps smooth page shift, and during frame 0-3 they see new page is purely empty and in frame 4-10 they see new page with content

If we require developers to think more about whether their widget/RO needs this, and how to create a custom one that will do the right thing, it's going to be very difficult for them to use. It might be very useful and a skilled developer might find very clever ways to do it, but it won't be something that will scale very well.

Well I guess yes and no. 
1. For anything that fit into a subtree, no need for dev to do anything except for inserting PreemptDisplayList widget to the tree
2. For list view scrolling, we do need to change listview's source code a bit, but flutter devs will not even know that change

Route transitions will always not fit into a leaf subtree indeed, but it is in my example 3.
> Scrolling isn't usually the big offender here - we have mechanisms to lazily build the contents of what's getting scrolled, and changing the offset on the layer of what's already built is cheap
@Nayuta 's Keframe deals with scrolling and is popular, and I also see problems in scrolling (both in my realworld app and my experiments), so I guess it may be a problem sometimes

@dnfield Well, maybe I forget to explain: Dev *never* need to do anything special for most of their app. The *only* extra thing is the part for 60fps smooth animation. Only if they want something to be very smooth, and it is not a leaf subtree (e.g. loading indicator) and not a scrolling listview and not a already-provided-in-framework page transition, they will have to write some extra code (in the current proposal).

Sure, I should do that. Probably create an app w/ page transition etc

Quick update: I am now experimenting multiple subtrees (i.e. a forest). Flutter seems to allow so (e.g. examples/api/lib/widgets/framework/build_owner.0.dart example). If this works, we may have a natural API, i.e. only insert a few extra Widgets to dev's widget tree and that's all, and @dnfield's worry will be solved.

for some reason I think maybe build in one frame, layout and paint in next frame is acceptable

Agree, if that is implementable looks like also an idea, as long as the build fits in 16ms

I would like to add:  this solution has less overhead than keframe. When Keframe replaces placeholder with real widget, it is driven by vsync signal to execute drawFrame process and submit to engine, so it will execute the complete build/layout/paint etc process. But build/layout/paint other than the actual widget is not necessary. In the Preempt Layout scheme, the UI thread just voluntarily submits a frame to the Engine after 16ms of detection, and then returns to the normal rendering flow without much additional overhead.

Update: minimalist API (one widget for everything) + a prototype about framework layer.

Now, developers will only need to insert `PreemptBuilder(builder: (context, child) => whatever_you_like, child: also_free_to_choose)` widget, and that's all. Arbitrary builder, arbitrary child subtree, and smooth 60fps will be there for the builder. The google doc is updated to discuss this - mainly in (1) "usage examples" (2) "From preemptModifyLayerTree to PreemptBuilder" in "detailed design".

I would rather think of an API like this would be useful
```
SlowSubtree(
    placeholder: Center(child: CupertinoActivityIndicator())
    child: MyBigScrollingPage()
)
```
And that child could be built over multiple frames. Main use case would be to not frame-drop during page push animation when the new page is complex. Seems like based on `build_owner.0.dart` example it can be possible to build arbitrary subtrees? But would need to modify the build owner in order to yield back and show the placeholder.

If someone has stackoverflow comment abilities can you please comment on this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/64167746/20063373  It assumes that the `builder` for `StreamBuilder` will get called 1-to-1 for the `Stream` events.

I think if we can find a way to do multithreading nobody is against it a priori.

If I may, it sounds like your proposal boils down to "provide developers with a way to mark areas of the tree that should be updated first (doing build, layout, paint, and semantics), then, if the time runs out during a frame, send the updated layer tree that only contains those parts and not the others, then continue doing the frame". Is that right?

If so, I think the main problem with this approach is that we'd have to rerun the rarely-mentioned (because it's so cheap) "animation" step that happens before build, so that the parts of the tree that need animating early can be updated with the new time stamp, but in the current model, that requires winding down the stack frame because between the "animation" and "build" phases we run microtasks.

I also worry that it would lead to some strange effects like how to determine which parts of the tree to update and which to not. For example, suppose you have three parts to your page. Part A is marked as needing fast updates, and parts B and C other two are expensive animations.

We start frame 1, we update all the AnimationControllers, we build/layout/paint/layer/semantics the first (A), then we start on B, and we do no build and layout of B. Then we interrupt the work to send the tree to the engine with A's update. We do a new animation phase to update all the AnimationControllers again, we build/layout/paint/layer/semantics the first (A), then we resume the work on the original frame. Now we build/layout C. Finally build and layout are done so we paint B and C and do the layer tree and render it. Unfortunately, because B and C were painted after different animation phases, they'll be out of sync. It'll look like the two animations are running at a low frame rate _and out of sync with each other_, which IMHO is worse than today (where they're just at a low frame rate).

That's assuming we can figure out how to do the animation phase at all.

However, the main problem is that, seems not to exist efficient implementable solutions for those ideas (some by googlers, some by bytedancers, some by me). They have either performance problems, or logical problems IIRC. I am also looking forward to see progress on those methods!

> boils down to ... Is that right?

Quite similar to my existing proposal, if it is implementable, sure.

> we'd have to rerun the rarely-mentioned (because it's so cheap) "animation" step ... because between the "animation" and "build" phases we run microtasks.

Indeed I am also quite curious why it was design like that, instead of putting animation into build/layout phase.
Anyway, if using the PreemptBuilder dev-facing API, dev just use a builder callback (like what we have done a million times) to drive animation, which is flexible.

> Unfortunately, because B and C were painted after different animation phases, they'll be out of sync.

Sorry I cannot get it. In my proposal, they always see the same vsync signal. Indeed, using the mental model (a section in this design doc), every code should just see the plain old janky environment, except for a small portion of the code (the one inside PreemptBuilder) which knows extra info.

> That's assuming we can figure out how to do the animation phase at all.

Currently I plan *not* to do the animation phase indeed, and just use the builder callback.

IIRC, Flutter officially supports us to using builder pattern for animations. For example, AnimatedBuilder is indeed implemented as `setState` per Listenable update, very similar to how we treat PreemptBuilder - build (setState?) per 60fps frame.

**Brief visual update: It runs at ~60fps, while widget build/layout needs ~500ms**

Video description: (1) The slow (plain-old) case is repeated twice (2) Then the fast (using PreemptBuilder) case is done twice (3) Lastly a debug animation is shown (to be explained below).

How to verify it is 60fps: I personally use `ffmpeg -i $VIDEO -vsync 0 -frame_pts true -vf drawtext=fontfile=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeMonoBold.ttf:fontsize=80:text='%{pts}':fontcolor=white@0.8:x=7:y=7 ~/temp/video_frames/output_%04d.jpg` to extract every frame of the video.

P.S. The last section in the video (debug animation) is used to verify the file transfer. If that part is seen janky, then it is probably a problem when transferring the video file etc, since that should definitely be 60FPS.

As usual, the code is at the GitHub branch mentioned above.

### `VsyncWaiter` schedules unneeded extra `AwaitVSync` callbacks for one frame

Consider the following sequence:

* ScheduleSecondaryCallback(id1, callback1)
* ScheduleSecondaryCallback(id2, callback2)

Then, without this fix, the AwaitVSync will be called twice. Then, FireCallback will be called twice at the beginning of the next frame. But we know that FireCallback calls all primary and secondary callbacks, so being called twice just waste some computation resource.

By the way, the following sequences are all ok without bugs:

* AsyncWaitForVsync
* ScheduleSecondaryCallback(id1)
* ScheduleSecondaryCallback(id2)

or

* ScheduleSecondaryCallback(id1)
* AsyncWaitForVsync
* ScheduleSecondaryCallback(id2)

Brief update in recent experiments: Overhead per frame is medium=0.53ms, p95=0.81ms, p99=1.10ms, on my low-end testing device, for the "enter-new-screen" demo. (Indeed it may not be called "overhead", since those time are really needed to update data for screen)

Not completely get the question... If the question is, whether animation happens when the complex widget is being built/layouted, the answer is yes.

> Because the effect could be replicated by just delaying the complex content build for ~500 ms (animation duration).

You need some extra preempt points, instead of a single `sleep(500ms)`. For example, this should work:

```
build() {
  for(var i=0;i<100;++i) {
    Actor.instance.maybePreemptRender();
    sleep(const Duration(milliseconds: 5));
  }
  return your widget;
}
```

Indeed, preempt points are auto injected via PreemptPoint, and (possibly done in the real PR) in every RenderObject.layout. So usually no need to manually write that.

By the way, your original modification does not work, because by default I do not expect a single widget.build to exceed 16ms. Anyway if that is the case just insert a few `maybePreemptRender`.

Good morning friends! Should I start making the PR?
@Hixie @Jonah Williams @dnfield @gaaclarke @Callum @ping (googlers who had discussions about this proposal)

The design doc has been overhauled:
* Add chapter "experiments (prototype)", showing videos, code demos, FPS analysis, and overhead analysis.
* Add section "needed code change", demonstrating what framework and engine code (few) needs to be modified.
* Overhaul chapter "comparison", elaborating the differences.

I want to sincerely say thanks to Flutter. Flutter has saved me months, if not a year, by allowing me to write a single codebase and run on dual platforms (saving half of the time), to use the very productive declarative framework and hot reload, to utilize the quickly-progressing Dart language with expressive and safe type system, to easily customize the appearance as accurate as pixel level, to be able to dig down and modify engine code when I need a new feature (impossible with Web), and many more.

That is a big reason why I decided to contribute this PR (Preemption for 60 FPS) to Flutter. Flutter has saved me so much time, so now it is my turn to provide my time to Flutter to make it better. I also love open source very much, such as my [flutter_rust_bridge](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge) open-source library (which could have been closed-source and only used by myself), and my previous PRs to Flutter fixing bugs, which is another driving force.

My proposed method is not sensitive to the threshold indeed. In other words, suppose you happen to pause at 15ms, then you do not necessarily need to finish UI thread work and submit to raster thread in 16.67-15=1.67ms. On the contrary, you can, e.g. finish in 2ms or 3ms or 4ms or whatever, as long as raster thread have enough time to finish his hob.

Some details can be found in the "when to call preemptRender" section

some of these changes are sort of fundamentally opposed to flutter's design philosophy
like, for example, the widget system shouldn't need to know about tickers
a developer should be able to build an entirely separate animation system and just layer it on top of the framework
but if we do what this proposal suggests, we're really saying that tickers are very special in a core sense

@fzyzcjy so for example, suppose instead of using a Ticker i have an animation that's driven by a Timer. every time it triggers, it changes some global state. then i have many widgets that follow that global state. with your proposal, the sections inside the special widget would not animate fast.

another example would be, suppose there's two RenderObjects and they each create a Layer and those Layers know they will always be used together because the RenderObjects are always used together. So they can rely on always existing as a pair and can always read the render object sizes and so on when the layer tree is walked.
now suppose one of those RenderObjects is in the "expensive" part of the subtree and the other is in the "fast" part of the subtree.
or suppose one is in the "expensive" part that got laid out before we interrupted layout, and the other is in the part that got laid out later.

the problem with a system like flutter's, which has many years of work already done on it, is that there's a lot of these assumptions and it's easy to just not know about some of them. e.g. i'm sure i don't know them all at this point.

flutter's tried to follow a "layered" approach, where there are very few "core" components that one _must_ use. For example, you can use RenderObjects without widgets. You can use widgets without material. You don't have to use WidgetsApp if you don't want to. You don't have to use Tickers if you don't want to. etc.

right my point is that TickerMode is just a widget. you don't have to use it. SingleTickerProviderStateMixin is just a tool, you don't have to use it. But if we say that SingleTickerProviderStateMixin now exposes a special API, we're saying it's special in a way that MyCustomSingleTickerProviderStateMixin is not, and can never be.

Sorry I do not quite get it. I am trying to modify SingleTickerProviderStateMixin in a ways that, originally it calls TickerMode (inherited widget), not it calls TickerMode + TickerRegistry (another inherited widget)

Or, for absolutely zero overhead: Maybe enable it by `bool.fromEnvironement` flag. IIRC those are compile time constants, and compilers will just handle them at compile time. for example, `kDebugMode ? heavy_work : cheap_work`, the heavy_work seems even not in the final binary

Users of the 3rd party package will need `--dart-define=enableTheTickerConfig=true` or something like that. And other users have exactly zero overhead.

that has the problem of being hard to test (we would need to run all the tests for every combination of these flags, which gets exponentially expensive)

I see the problem. What about this:
```
bool? debugOverrideTheFlag;
bool get theFlag {
  var ans;
  assert(() => ans = debugOverrideTheFlag);
  return ans ?? bool.fromEnvironment('the.flag');
}
```
It has zero overhead in release (given it is just a compile time constant). And it has testability (just debugOverrideTheFlag)

I am still calling window.render inside the BeginFrame callback, because the preemptRender is a function called from build/layout functions which is called from BeginFrame. I just call it multiple times (instead of one time).

### Exposing hook about tickers with zero overhead

1. I will finish code details, refine code, add tests, make tests pass, etc, after a code review that thinks the *rough idea* is acceptable. It is because, from my past experience, reviews may request changing a lot. If the general idea is to be changed, all detailed implementation efforts are wasted :)
2. The PR has an already-working counterpart, and it produces ~60FPS smooth experimental results. The benchmark results and detailed analysis is in chapter https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/benchmark/. All the source code is in  https://github.com/fzyzcjy/engine/tree/flutter-smooth and https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter/tree/flutter-smooth.
3. Possibly useful as a context to this PR, there is a whole chapter discussing the internals - how flutter_smooth is implemented. (Link: https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/design/)

### Exposing hook for RenderObject.layout with zero overhead

1. I will finish code details, refine code, add tests, make tests pass, etc, after a code review that thinks the *rough idea* is acceptable. It is because, from my past experience, reviews may request changing a lot. If the general idea is to be changed, all detailed implementation efforts are wasted :)
2. The PR has an already-working counterpart, and it produces ~60FPS smooth experimental results. The benchmark results and detailed analysis is in chapter https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/benchmark/. All the source code is in  https://github.com/fzyzcjy/engine/tree/flutter-smooth and https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter/tree/flutter-smooth.
3. Possibly useful as a context to this PR, there is a whole chapter discussing the internals - how flutter_smooth is implemented. (Link: https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/design/)

**Remark:** This PR has less priority compared with the other two (https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36438, https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/112436), because this one can be workaround, while the other two are really mandatory to implement PreemptBuilder.

We do not resume or retry. We just _call_ preemptRender function as any normal function call, and just _return_ from it. So zero cost.

I have not done thorough experiments (e.g. ListView scrolling) so cannot give a conclusion now. But it seems this package will cover all cases with less drawbacks and better performance, by solving the problem in a different approach.

Any sliver expert: Is it expected to provide a custom `SliverChildDelegate` for good performance? Since with the default `SliverChildBuilderDelegate`, all the children will be rebuilt if the parent is rebuilt.

Yeah that's true. For reasons, I have both pages rebuild during page pop, so the frame drop was quite noticeable. Both lists didn't need to rebuild as no change in the content, it's a good feature that was not immediately obvious.

I'd be really surprised if there is a significant framedrop from _just_ rebuilding widgets. Do you have some sample code I could look at? I've been looking at scrolling performance issues the last couple of weeks, usually what goes wrong is folks accidentally making the entire list render (even offscreen) and that can be quite slow

The list items are quite complex paragraphs, during scrolling it can be okay to have 1-2ms build times. But if 24 of them build at once (12 on each page) during the page pop, it's going to drop frames.

@dnfield Hi, thanks for the quick reply :)

> The documentation on FlutterView.render specifies when it is safe/allowed to call render.

I will change that doc accordingly (probably after we come to a conclusion what should be done for this PR)

> I'm not quite clear on how this will affect the pipeline - it seems like it will now be trivial for a dart:ui application to flood the pipeline if we remove guardrails around when you can call render. Today the contract is that the application can expect that it's time to call render because it got a call to onBeginFrame. In this world, the application calls render whenever it thinks it has been working too long and might want to give an update. But the application doesn't know about vsync and it will be very hard to reason about why render is getting called if we make this change.
> I don't think we should make this change. It too easily allows wasted work to happen.

Firstly, IMHO, a normal flutter app calls `window.render` once per frame, so no problem at all for all existing app.

Secondly, in my proposal (`Preempt for 60 FPS`), I do observe vsync (using VsyncAwaiter class), and only submit one `window.render` per vsync. Therefore, "But the application doesn't know about vsync" seems not to be the situation, and thus "it will be very hard to reason about why render is getting called" is also no problem.

That said, I do agree that, if the rasterizer thread takes too long (e.g. takes 50ms for one rasterize), it is a waste to submit a Scene per 16.6ms (but should submit per 50ms).

If this is still a problem for you, can I change as follows: Add a flag to `window.render`, say, `window.render({bool onlyRenderOncePerBeginFrame = true})`. Then the behavior will be exactly the same, except for someone who really needs this (e.g. the Preempt proposal).

In addition, given it is a so low-level API that most people will never touch, it seems reasonable to provide some flexibility to it.

@dnfield Another possibility for Dart code to understand the queue is full so it do not do anything more:

Add this 4-line function:

```c++
// return: whether it is prepared successfully. If return false, it means pipeline is full, 
// and thus the user should not really compute the Scene to avoid unnecessary work.
bool Animator::PrepareExtraRender() {
  if (!producer_continuation_) {
    producer_continuation_ = layer_tree_pipeline_->Produce();
  }
  return static_cast<bool>(producer_continuation_);
}
```

usage:

```dart
realize_next_vsync_comes; // see the design for details https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FuNcBvAPghUyjeqQCOYxSt6lGDAQ1YxsNlOvrUx0Gko/edit
var prepared = window.prepareExtraRender();
if (prepared) {
  ui.Scene scene = compute_the_scene();
  window.render(scene);
} else {
  // do not do anything since the rasterizer queue is already so full
  // this mimic the behavior of Animator::BeginFrame, where we skip the current frame if it is full
}
```

> @dnfield ... be trivial for a dart:ui application to flood the pipeline ...

IMHO the pipeline seems not to be flooded - it has depth 2. In other words, even if we call `window.render(scene)` a million times within a frame, only the first two scenes will be in the queue, and the rest 999998 will just be thrown away (suppose rasterizer has not processed any). So we are still safe.

For a dart:ui application, if needed, it can use the `window.prepareExtraRender` extra call to see whether the queue is already full, to avoid generating scene etc (just like example above).

> Today the contract is that the application can expect that it's time to call render because it got a call to onBeginFrame. In this world, the application calls render whenever it thinks it has been working too long and might want to give an update.

Just as mentioned above, adding a flag like `window.render({bool onlyRenderOncePerBeginFrame = true})` seems to solve the "contract" problem.

Reviews typically happen once per week during triage meetings. I've looked at some of these PRs already though and there seems to be some missing context here. These changes don't seem quite safe on their own, and it's still not clear to me what's the bigger picture app that they fix. I think we've talked about having a sample application or benchmark that shows what you're improving - is that available (even if it requires some special patches to the engine or framework to run, that's ok)

@dnfield 

**What is the big picture that it fixes?**

The ultimate goal is, let the app run smoothly at 60FPS, even if it has heavy subtree that is very slow to build/layout. In other words, the design doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FuNcBvAPghUyjeqQCOYxSt6lGDAQ1YxsNlOvrUx0Gko

It already has a working demo. See the (new) "experiments" chapter, with a video, screenshots, full code, brief code, benchmark, analysis.

**What's the main goal you're trying to achieve with this particular change?**

In order to solve that big goal, we must let animation callbacks run at 60FPS even if the whole tree is very slow to build/layout. Otherwise, even if we refresh a subtree by 60FPS, anything like CircularProgressIndicator, FooTransition, or manual AnimationController will all never be smooth, because they do not see new timestamp at 60FPS.

Then, to fire (extra) animation callbacks, a natural solution is to work with the `Ticker`s. Originally, `Ticker`s are fired once per frame. But now, we also extra fire it (with proper timestamp) in each 60FPS smooth extra frame.

Lastly, to fire extra events to `Ticker`s , we must know the existence of Tickers in the auxiliary widget subtree (no need for Tickers in the main subtree since they should not be fired at 60FPS). That is why I added a callback when Tickers are created - then I can record it such that to fire extra ticks.

**Why is it doing it this way?**

Why it is a compile time flag `FLUTTER_ENABLE_TICKER_PROVIDER_STATE_MIXIN_CREATOR`: Because Hixie is worried about performance loss (in Discord hackers-framework). Making it a compile time flag, then nobody will have any even tiny bit of performance loss, if they do not need this feature.

Why there is `debugOverrideEnableTickerProviderStateMixinTickerCreator` in addition to compile time flag: Because Hixie said compile time flags are hard to test. By using this `debugOverride...` flag we can test it easily (indeed I have written tests there).

Why a context must be passed to the callback: Because as mentioned above, I need to determine whether it is in the second subtree or main subtree.

Btw the name is temporary, just suggest any name you like :)

**Why can't we used existing mechanisms to achieve the same thing?**

Well, Hixie and I have tried, but cannot come up with a solution :/ Feel free to suggest solutions! Microscopic speaking, seems that cannot know a Ticker in a TickerProviderMixin is created so cannot gather them. Macroscopic speaking, did not find other ways to let it be smooth.

**Why do we need this mechanism to achieve the larger goal of having incremental/progressive layout?**

Hope this question is clear with above ;)

I agree theoretically. But during my experiments, I see about 39% of the UI thread time is idle, and I guess GC does not need that much time. This screenshot: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5236035/190553863-5a373dcb-75ba-468d-8118-66e7a393070b.png

I really appreciate your enthusiasm for this topic! But I'm still not sure I understand the big picture purpose of this method. You've explained some of the specifics about why you're guarding certain things the way you are, which isn't really what's unclear to me. What's unclear to me is why we want tickers to have an artificial way to fire an extra tick.

Just add maybePreemptRender to that _single_ layout function. For example:

class VeryHeavySingleLayout extends RenderObject {
void performLayout() {
compute_heavy_things_part_1;
maybePreemptRender();
compute_heavy_things_part_2;
maybePreemptRender();
...
compute_heavy_things_part_5;

This is related to the engine PR concerns - it seems like we're struggling a bit to find the right way to express the concept of vsync/animation frame. The platform gives us a very clear signal, and I would like to avoid adding methods to the engine or framework to override that.

1. Insert a maybePreemptRender to RenderObject.layout function seems enough, without breaking anything if I think correctly.
2. I also think about another possibility, just do it the way now it is. In other words, let the user manually specify preempt points via SmoothPreemptPoint. Then one less PR to framework, and user has more flexibility.

Thanks! 🙂

Because tickers originally fire once per full pipeline, in the animation phase. But now we want it to run extra ticks in the 60fps smooth extra frame. 
> it seems like we're struggling a bit to find the right way to express the concept of vsync/animation frame. 
I do respect vsync, just using a way other than "be fired by onBeginFrame" (because when we are busy running dart code, the callback can never be fired again). Shortly speaking, I let VsyncAwaiter set a thread-shared variable about the last vsync data. Then in maybePreemptRender, I read that data. (Briefly speaking) if it is a new vsync, I realize it is time to create Scene and submit via window.render. Thus I submit once per vsync and respect vsync well.
> The platform gives us a very clear signal, and I would like to avoid adding methods to the engine or framework to override that.
I would also like to make as few changes as possible, if it is possible 🙂
Not sure what "clear signal" mean, but if it means "the vsync signal", then hope my explanaions above solve the problem - I do respect the clear signal as well in another way

If we are worried that users may submit multiple window.render inside one vsync, another possibility: We may add some code in the C++ layer (or Dart layer), such that we check current vsync status, and *only* `Produce()` if it is a new vsync that has not been produced before.

The current possibly hard part for that potential PR: in android sdk>=29 and ios, seems that the  callback of VsyncWaiter is fired on ui thread. But our Dart code is occupying the UI thread (for a long time) so that vsync callback may not be fired. For old android it does work well because it is fired in platform thread (my example is based on that)

I agree. But seems that we need to compare two cases:
1. Without this new proposal: Suppose one frame is 100ms, then we have busy UI thread for 100ms without idle. And then frame ends so we have idle.
2. With this proposal: We still be busy for 100ms (+3% overhead so indeed 103ms), and then get idle. In addition, we have 6 extra smooth frames which may generate some object.

Thus, the difference with this proposal is that, the objects we create inside extra smooth frame do give GC extra pressure. But I hope that is small - they are just animations.

<DiscussionComment author="fzyzcjy" link="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FuNcBvAPghUyjeqQCOYxSt6lGDAQ1YxsNlOvrUx0Gko/edit?disco=AAAAhGPEyBc" source="google_doc_comments" createTime="2022-09-29T00:09:30.460Z">

Moreover, IMHO, my approach allows GC to happen, as long as it is less than 16ms stop-the-world and is not very unlucky.

For example, suppose GC happens during 17ms to 20ms. Then I can still build the layer tree and submit window.render at around 33.33ms. That stop-the-world GC does not cause any problem like visible jank. As long as we have about 0.5ms per 16.667ms, because 0.5ms is what we need (in experiments below) to produce an extra smooth frame.

On the contrary, existing methods may have jank in such cases. Because if GC runs for 3ms, they have 3ms less to compute the next scene.

I have `git blame` and find the bug exist since the first version 7yr ago, and no special comments about why this is introduced so I guess it is but not feature.

IMHO the bug may be written like, the programmer wants to convert DateTime (the `clock.now()`) into a Duration. But then it is forgotten that both are microseconds precision instead of milliseconds precision, and the milliseconds approach is used.

### Export `elapseBlocking` to test binding, so slow sync work can be simulated such as a slow widget build

There are needs to simulate sync heavy work, such as a slow widget build, in flutter widget tests. This method simply expose that.

As a remark, this cannot be replaced by `runAsync`. Consider the following example:

```dart
    testWidgets('can use to simulate slow build', (WidgetTester tester) async {
      final DateTime beforeTime = binding.clock.now();

      await tester.pumpWidget(Builder(builder: (_) {
        bool timerCalled = false;
        Timer.run(() => timerCalled = true);

        binding.elapseBlocking(const Duration(seconds: 1));

        // if we use `delayed` instead of `elapseBlocking`, such as
        // binding.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 1));
        // the timer will be called here. Surely, that violates how
        // a flutter widget build works
        expect(timerCalled, false);

        return Container();
      }));

      expect(binding.clock.now(), beforeTime.add(const Duration(seconds: 1)));
      binding.idle();
    });
```

As is discussed in the comments in the example, if we use `delayed`, timers will be fired when executing half of a build function, which is totally wrong.

@dnfield If speed is a concern, maybe the original PR is ok: For a normal usage, it only adds `if (!producer_continuation_)` (and that if will return false immediately). Given that `explicit operator bool() const { return continuation_ != nullptr; }`, this if will only check whether a pointer is nullptr, so I guess it is only a few CPU cycles (per 16667 microseconds, i.e. maybe 10000000 cycles). In addition, for a normal usage, the branch will always be false, so IMHO the cpu branch predictor will be quite correct about the prediction.

> @dnfield giving developers a button to push that actually makes things slower

There seems to be another way that is not very slower:

Firstly, the `onlyRenderOncePerBeginFrame` should not be `window.render(onlyRenderOncePerBeginFrame: true)`, but be `window.onlyRenderOncePerBeginFrame = true; window.render()`. In other words, it should be a flag that is set once. Then the code is:

```c++
...
  if (!onlyRenderOncePerBeginFrame && !producer_continuation_) {
    producer_continuation_ = layer_tree_pipeline_->Produce();
  }
...

void SetOnlyRenderOncePerBeginFrame(bool value) { this->onlyRenderOncePerBeginFrame = value; }
class Animator { ... bool onlyRenderOncePerBeginFrame; ... }
```

(no need for locks, since all on UI thread.)

Then there comes the concern that `if (!onlyRenderOncePerBeginFrame && !producer_continuation_)` can cost CPU cycles, even when onlyRenderOncePerBeginFrame is always true (for a classical user). Firstly, for a classical user, we only pay extra cost of `if(boolean)` (because && is short-circuited), so only a few cycles.

Secondly, seems we can use the `[[likely]]` (c++20), or `LIKELY` (a lot of c++ library write their own version for that, e.g. see [how linux])(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/109710/how-do-the-likely-unlikely-macros-in-the-linux-kernel-work-and-what-is-their-ben) does that), to further hint compiler about this case to speed up.

@dnfield And for *zero* speed decrease if you like:

The `Animator::PrepareExtraRender` proposal seems to cause zero speed loss for a classical user. Because a classical user never calls that function, and only call Animator::Render. But Animator::Render is not modified in this proposal. For a smooth user, there does exist overhead, because need to call one extra C++ function - the PrepareExtraRender.

Quick update (still WIP, just provide some progress): I am working on the gesture system. Jonah Williams has thought that, it was bad that my old proposal did not let the pointer data packet go through Flutter's gesture system. Now, the new method just calls the classical `gestureBinding.handlePointerEvent` to dispatch `PointerMoveEvent`s.

### Fix logic error in `markNeedsPaint`

The original code comment says:

> If we're the root of the render tree (probably a RenderView), then we have to paint ourselves, since nobody else can paint us. We don't add ourselves to _nodesNeedingPaint in this case, because the root is always told to paint regardless.

However, IMHO it is wrong in two aspects.

### Problem 1: RenderView does not come to this branch

Firstly, for a `RenderView`, it will not go into this branch, but instead go into the first branch (the `if (isRepaintBoundary && _wasRepaintBoundary)`). This is because RenderView.isRepaintBoundary is defined to be true, which can be seen in the code.

The experiment also confirms this. Click to expand below:

<details>

Add a few logs:

Code:

```
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('hello', (tester) async {
    debugPrintBeginFrameBanner = debugPrintEndFrameBanner = true;

    final dummy = ValueNotifier(0);
    await tester.pumpWidget(ValueListenableBuilder(
      valueListenable: dummy,
      builder: (_, dummy, __) => _DummyInner(dummy: dummy),
    ));

    dummy.value++;
    await tester.pump();

    debugPrintBeginFrameBanner = debugPrintEndFrameBanner = false;
  });
}

class _DummyInner extends SingleChildRenderObjectWidget {
  final int dummy;

  const _DummyInner({
    super.key,
    required this.dummy,
    super.child,
  });

  @override
  _RenderDummy createRenderObject(BuildContext context) =>
      _RenderDummy(dummy: dummy);

  @override

    RenderBox? child,
  })  : _dummy = dummy,
        super(child);

  // not mark repaint yet
  int get dummy => _dummy;
  int _dummy;

  set dummy(int value) {
    if (_dummy == value) return;
    _dummy = value;
    print('hi ${describeIdentity(this)} set dummy thus markNeedsPaint START');
    markNeedsPaint();
    print('hi ${describeIdentity(this)} set dummy thus markNeedsPaint END');
  }

  @override
  void paint(PaintingContext context, Offset offset) {
    print('hi ${describeIdentity(this)}.paint SUPPOSE THIS IS THE REAL PAINT');
    super.paint(context, offset);
  }
}
```

```

</details>

By looking at the experiment above, we see that, the `RenderView` goes to the `case-repaintboundary` which is the first branch, instead of the third branch, so the comments seem incorrect.

### Problem 2: Root is not always told to paint indeed

Theoretically, I do not find clues why "root is always told to paint" indeed. Experimentically, this is also confirmed as below.

We change the branching condition as follows, so RenderView is forced to go to the 3rd branch (the branch with comments), instead of the 1st branch.

```diff
-     if (isRepaintBoundary && _wasRepaintBoundary) {
+     if (isRepaintBoundary && _wasRepaintBoundary && /*HACK!!!*/(this is! RenderView)) {
```

Then we run the test code same as above (only with a few more logging), and get:

<details>

</details>

As we can see, RenderView.paint and RenderDummy.paint is only called once, even though we clearly call `RenderDummy.markNeedsPaint`. That is indeed a bug, and at least shows that the code comment is wrong - root is not always told to paint.

### Add warning that `RenderRepaintBoundary.toImage` and `OffsetLayer.toImage` is slow

Scene.toImage has doc saying: "This is a slow operation that is performed on a background thread". However, people may use `RenderRepaintBoundary.toImage` and `OffsetLayer.toImage` and never read that comment, so they are unaware of the slowness. This PR simply adds the warning to them.

```

</details>

It seems that, the `layer_tree` is directly moved into `raster_task_runner` callbacks. Then, inside the raster thread, `layer_tree->Flatten` is called and it is converted to a DisplayList. In other words, the "thread transport mechanism" seems to be the `layer_tree` (ui -> raster thread) and `DlImage` (raster -> ui thread), instead of the "flatten the layer tree into a picture and use that" (the flattened layer tree, i.e. the picture).

@jonahwilliams Hi thanks for the reply.

* If it is slow, IMHO the users need to know it, otherwise users may abuse it because they may think it is just a normal function.
* If it is fast, then we need to remove the original comment (because it is outdated).
* As for impl specific, if it is slow but in the future it becomes fast (hopefully!), seems that we can update comments at that time.

Anyway this is just a small doc change and it does not matter whether it is changed or not for myself (since I already know it is slow and should be careful). I have spent some making this PR simply because I hope other users works correctly with the api :)

You're discounting the time it takes to actually make a native call from Dart.

On top of that, we should not expose an API that might or might not do something and developers have no good way to reason about whether they're really supposed to call it or not.

This proposal is fundamentally changing the invariants around `render`/`onBeginFrame`, but it's not providing any way for developers to know if they're using the new invariants correctly or not. Even if the new potentially useless API is relatively cheap, it adds up when developers (and packages they use) start doing it multiple times per frame. And those developers/packages will have no way to know whether they're doing it correctly or not, so it will definitely get misused.

Why, for example, shouldn't the framework just call render and schedule a new frame when its hit its potential limit?

@dnfield Hi thanks for the reply.

> You're discounting the time it takes to actually make a native call from Dart.

Originally I thought that is small just like a normal function call... Ok now I learn it.

> On top of that, we should not expose an API that might or might not do something and developers have no good way to reason about whether they're really supposed to call it or not.

Indeed they have a way to reason: look at time or vsync info. They should not submit twice inside one vsync interval.

> This proposal is fundamentally changing the invariants around render/onBeginFrame, but it's not providing any way for developers to know if they're using the new invariants correctly or not.

I am not sure, if I expose the vsync info and ensure only one call is made per vsync interval (16.67ms), does this satisfy your requirement?

> Even if the new potentially useless API is relatively cheap, it adds up when developers (and packages they use) start doing it multiple times per frame. 

Again, as mentioned above, dev should not call it multiple times per frame. A naive dev may use `DateTime.now() - last_vsync_time > 15ms` etc to check, and a more sophisticated way may be read the vsync info (exposed from engine) to really ensure we never call twice per vsync interval. 

> And those developers/packages will have no way to know whether they're doing it correctly or not, so it will definitely get misused.

Then maybe we should return `bool` to indicate whether it is really scheduled. If they see a lot of `false` they are doing it wrong (call too many times that are useless).

> Why, for example, shouldn't the framework just call render and schedule a new frame when its hit its potential limit?

Because of the fundamental design of the preempt proposal (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FuNcBvAPghUyjeqQCOYxSt6lGDAQ1YxsNlOvrUx0Gko/edit), mainly "The flow chart" section.

Indeed, window.render is called per vsync interval (16.67ms). The main difference from classical code is that, it may be called multiple times per onBeginFrame (when onBeginFrame is super slow).

Devices do not always have 60fps vsync - sometimes it's 90 or 120 or more or less (at one point we had a customer looking at 240hz devices, and it's likely there are customers out there looking at 30hz use cases). There is no way currently in dart:ui to know what the current refresh rate is, and on some platforms it's not even possible to implement because the vendors don't provide an API for it (e.g. some Android vendors), and it can change from frame to frame.

In other words, a developer must not assume that 16.67ms is the right interval for a frame in all circumstances. And the query of `DateTime.now` is almost certain to _not_ match the actual vsync start time, so if you assume you have roughly 16ms from onBeginFrame you might actually overshoot vsync.

Definitely! That's why I also propose to expose vsync-related information to the dev. Last week you asked me to describe it and it was at "Get last vsync time information" section of google doc.

> And the query of DateTime.now is almost certain to not match the actual vsync start time, so if you assume you have roughly 16ms from onBeginFrame you might actually overshoot vsync.

Totally agree. Indeed in my (previous) implementation, I let the C++ side expose the `timeStamp` (i.e. vsync target time we provide to dart tonBeginFrame) both a "Duration" and a "DateTime-compatible time". If you like I can add that back (deleted it b/c want to make PR small).

P.S. I am also considering relaxing when to start a onBeginFrame which seems to reduce unnecessary idle time and improve performance. That may be related to the big picture you are concerned - how vsync and code are interacted. I will add it to design doc and reply here maybe in an hour.

I think it would be easier to start with a patch that exposes more about vsync timings to the developer, because that will be critical to whether this one makes sense.

### Expose `vsync` information to developer

This PR tries to expose vsync information to the developer, so they can know when it is proper to call the more un-restricted `window.render` proposed in #36438.

Currently only the API is shown, because IMHO the implementation details is unrelated to thoughts about #36438, and the API (and therefore implementations) are subject to changes. I will continue working on it, once the API is approved.

For detailed design about this API and its implementation, please have a look at "Get last vsync time information" section of https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FuNcBvAPghUyjeqQCOYxSt6lGDAQ1YxsNlOvrUx0Gko/edit.

Sample usage:

```dart
final info = SchedulerBinding.instance.lastVsyncInfo();
```

List of work:

- [x] code the (draft) Dart API
- [ ] discuss whether the API is acceptable
- [ ] implement the C++ part on SDK<=29 Android
- [ ] implement the C++ part on new android, ios, and other platforms
- [ ] create a wrapper function in `flutter/flutter` repo, probably in `SchedulerBinding`

*List which issues are fixed by this PR. You must list at least one issue.*

*If you had to change anything in the [flutter/tests] repo, include a link to the migration guide as per the [breaking change policy].*

This patch is missing a lot of context information. To quote Dan from the other patch:

> This patch needs a lot more context.

> Why is it doing it this way?
> Why can't we used existing mechanisms to achieve the same thing?
> Why do we need this mechanism to achieve the larger goal of having incremental/progressive layout?

Regardless, this doesn't seem like a great API to provide a single static callback that gets called on every layout. What if multiple implementations are trying to set this?
Also, this gets called for the layout of every single RenderObject. This doesn't sound great for performance. I know, the title claims it has no overhead, but I find that hard to believe. What's the basis for that claim?

I mean zero overhead *when it is disabled* (which IIRC is what hixie(?) cares about a lot). 

Compiler explorer says it is zero overhead b/c the compiler just correctly understands it and eliminate the dead code: https://discord.com/channels/608014603317936148/608021234516754444/1024141725024923688

### Quick update: ListView scrolling at 60FPS with heavy build/layout

Highlights:

* It is 60FPS <small>(check via splitting video into frames, and by my script to examine timeline tracing data; not checked this demo video though; you can find the script in my repo)</small>
* The list shifting is (roughly) uniform speed (up to error from OS pointer events) <small>(check via script to examine timeline tracing data; again script is in my repo)</small>
* The system uses `gestureBinding.handlePointerEvent` to dispatch `PointerMoveEvent`s

Experiment setup: Slow build/layout when new item comes in. Full code can be seen in https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_smooth.

May still contain (a lot of) bugs, since it is still WIP :)

**ListView scrolling at 60FPS with heavy build/layout**

Highlights:

* It is 60FPS <small>(check via splitting video into frames, and by my script to examine timeline tracing data; not checked this demo video though; you can find the script in my repo)</small>
* The list shifting is (roughly) uniform speed (up to error from OS pointer events) <small>(check via script to examine timeline tracing data; again script is in my repo)</small>
* The system uses `gestureBinding.handlePointerEvent` to dispatch `PointerMoveEvent`s

Experiment setup: Slow build/layout when new item comes in. Full code can be seen in https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_smooth.

May still contain (a lot of) bugs, since it is still WIP 🙂

@fzyzcjy @goderbauer this is a breaking change. Can a migration guide be written on how developers can migrate their code with this change? I'm not sure what's needed on my end as a developer, and my animation tests are now very flaky.

Could you please share some flaky test minimal reproducible samples? IMHO this should not make any problem so want to see reproductions in order to know what happens

Here's an example now that is flaky:

```dart
      await tester.pumpWidget(myAnimatedWidget);
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();

      await tester.sendSelectEvent();

      await tester.pumpFrames(scene, Duration(milliseconds: 100));
      await expectLater(
          find.byType(MyAnimatedWidget),
          matchesGoldenFile(
              'animated_widget'));
```

The resulting goldens are changing. When I change `pumpFrames` to microseconds, I am still seeing the same flakiness. I'm unsure if it's because the earlier clocks are still in millisecond mode.

@CaseyHillers Weird. Some possible ideas:

1. Do you have anything that depends on e.g. a real clock? If so, it will be flaky. (I guess no)
2. Could you please change `MyAnimatedWidget` to something like `AnimatedBuilder(builder: (_, value) => Text('the value is: $value')`. Then, when the golden is changing, we can know what value indeed it is having.

> I'm unsure if it's because the earlier clocks are still in millisecond mode.

Do you mean the new golden (i.e. after the PR) are different from old golden, and the new golden is itself stable? If so, looks like it is possible. Indeed the animation controller is fed with a changed animation time.

My animated widgets are just an animated builder that has a custom animation controller. @goderbauer or @pdblasi-google can help with reproducing the issue here.

My understanding is I need to change every possible clock to be in microseconds instead of milliseconds. This seems to be a breaking change for any other customers, and I'm having a difficult time tracking all the various clocks in my codebase.

I haven't found the discord threads, but I wonder if this is something that should be in the framework. There could be a tester field added for high precision or this can be added directly to your package. I assume most Flutter tests aren't needing high precision, and this is going to cause a lot of pain once it's in beta/stable.

Btw I am curious why a clock can in milliseconds in codebase - `clock` package, `Duration`, DateTime, etc are all in microseconds.

I agree that an alternative solution is to use a bool flag to enable high-accuracy (I have done that indeed - https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/112609/commits/e0b5882b87bc8fe025d55d626ec663c8587522b7).

### Reland `AutomatedTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.pump` provides wrong pump time stamp, probably because of forgetting the precision, via optional flag

This relands https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/112609, but with a flag that is off by default. The reason why it is designed like this can be found in discussions around https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/112609#issuecomment-1278889389.

@fzyzcjy @CaseyHillers @goderbauer

I still think that this change should be made without the boolean flag. The underlying issue with the goldens is that `pumpFrames` defines `interval` with microsecond precision, but the `AutomatedTestWidgetsFlutterBinding` didn't support microsecond precision. @Piinks and I went over a couple of golden changes in the flutter repos test as well and accepted the changes to those goldens as they were a change to a correct state (which is why the goldens are current hanging for this PR).

The secondary issue that makes this difficult to break cleanly is that `LiveWidgetsFlutterBinding` _does_ support microsecond precision, so we can't just update `pumpFrames`' `interval` parameter to be a clean 16 milliseconds by default, as that would break _other tests_.

To start with, the first paragraph in the [breaking changes process](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#handling-breaking-changes) says:

> Sometimes, however, doing this is necessary for the greater good. We want our APIs to be intuitive; if being backwards-compatible requires making an API into something that we would never have designed that way unless forced to by circumstances, then we should instead break the API and make it good.

Adding a boolean to make the _correct_ behavior happen is not an API that we would have designed on purpose. It's also not a change that we can easily guide people to using, as there's no "new API" we can drive them towards with deprecations or data driven fixes. It'd be something we introduce for a period of time, hope people read the blog, then end up running into the same "breaking change" issues when we eventually remove the boolean or default it to true.

From there, digging into the process, the preferred process is the three step process:

1. Add new API and opt in to the new API
2. Remove the old API
3. Remove the opt in

I think the only way we can get that to happen is to introduce a new version of `pumpFrames` that would support the correct behavior, deprecate the current `pumpFrames`, then eventually remove `pumpFrames`. Here's what I'd propose:

* Fix `AutomatedTestWidgetsFlutterBinding` _without_ the flag
* Introduce a new method with the exact contents that `pumpFrames` currently has:

```
pumpFramesFor(
  Widget target,
  Duration duration, [
    Duration interval = const Duration(milliseconds: 16, microseconds: 683),
  ])
```
* Update `pumpFrames` to pass through to the new `pumpFramesFor` method:
    * Check `if (binding is AutomatedTestWidgetsFlutterBinding)`
    * If it is, then truncate the microseconds off of `interval` before passing through to maintain the current incorrect behavior

My biggest concern with this approach is that `pumpFramesFor` isn't as clean a name as just `pumpFrames`, but it's the best I can come up with. Names aside, introducing a new method and deprecating the old is the only way I can think of to keep the existing behavior and actually be able to drive users to the new api before landing the correct behavior.

### Fix wrong `VSYNC` event

Firstly, we know `VSYNC` event in timeline is special - `chrome://tracing` tool will show "zebra" colors (gray and white) at every VSYNC. Therefore, it is critical to let this event have correct timing, otherwise every user is doing reasoning with the wrong vsync time.

In the image below, the "a" shows the new VSYNC with this PR, while the "b" shows the old VSYNC interval before this PR. As we can see, the left side of "a" and "b" does not coincide. In other words, before this PR (where we have "b" as the VSYNC and there is no "a"), we consider the wrong time as the vsync time.

The cause is quite simple: Before this PR, the left edge of "VSYNC" event is (for example) the call time of `VsyncWaiterAndroid::OnVsyncFromJava`. However, there exist "frame delay" (e.g. `frameDelayNanos` argument in `OnVsyncFromJava`), so the real vsync time should minus that delay.

As a side remark, in the image below the difference is not very much, but in real scenarios, I have seen once in a while it has large differences. Then you know, the visualization goes wild, and it took me some time before I realized, it is not a bug in code anywhere, but a bug of the VSYNC event time.

### Allow disable report timing in profile build since it takes not-negligible amount of time

Flutter [does say](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/PlatformDispatcher/onReportTimings.html) the time cost is "less than 0.1ms every 1 second to report the timings measured on iPhone6S". However, not every mobile phone is as high-end as iPhone6S. For example, on my testing device (TRT-AL00, indeed not the lowest-end device!), I measured that it takes about 20-30ms per second. Then we have a problem. When having https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_smooth, we know a big janky frame (say, takes 200ms) will never let user really feel janky, but instead user will see the app being 60FPS smooth. However, this is based on the assumption that misc work such as report timings should not block the UI thread for a continuous period of time - which is not true if report timings happens. After the 200ms janky frame, we see about 6ms of report timing. Among with other things such as dispatch touch events, they easily take up more than ~16ms and we get one jank. Then flutter_smooth is no longer smooth due to the jank.

Except for the case of flutter_smooth, IMHO this PR is also useful for normal Flutter users. It takes 2-3% of CPU time, which is not negligible and may be measured. In addition, this is not a critical feature. Surely, when this is disabled, the DevTool will not show the frame ui/rasterizer time at all. However, not everyone needs to read that timing data, since they may either do not open DevTool, or use the tracing timeline instead (which contains more than enough information to know the frame timing data). Therefore, it looks reasonable to at least give users a *chance* (i.e. a flag) to disable it.

The code is deliberately written by reading a const bool environment variable. Therefore, it has completely zero overhead. I have confirmed that by using compiler explorer before - https://discordapp.com/channels/608014603317936148/608021234516754444/1024141682377236500.

### Expose `NotifyIdle` from RuntimeController to Dart, allowing `flutter_smooth` to get 60FPS, even if GC needs to run for 14ms per 16.67ms

1. I will finish code details, refine code, add tests, make tests pass, etc, after a code review that thinks the *rough idea* is acceptable. It is because, from my past experience, reviews may request changing a lot. If the general idea is to be changed, all detailed implementation efforts are wasted :)
2. The PR has an already-working counterpart, and it produces ~60FPS smooth experimental results. The benchmark results and detailed analysis is in chapter https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/benchmark/. All the source code is in  https://github.com/fzyzcjy/engine/tree/flutter-smooth and https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter/tree/flutter-smooth.
3. Possibly useful as a context to this PR, there is a whole chapter discussing the internals - how flutter_smooth is implemented. (Link: https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/design/)

---



The PR simply exposes `RuntimeController::NotifyIdle` to the dart layer.

It is necessary for https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_smooth because of the following commonly seen scenario: Suppose we are in a janky frame (say it takes 200ms). Then, NotifyIdle is *never* called at all, because it is usually called at the end of DrawFrame (indeed, more exactly, in the Animator::AwaitVSync). Then, during the 200ms, garbage accumulates, and at one time the young generation is full, then Dart VM must stop the world and make a GC. From my experiments, such GC can even take 20ms on my testing device. Stop the world for 20ms - then we must miss one frames, causing non-60FPS. Even if the stop-the-world GC is fast, say, 5ms, it can still cause a jank. For example, when it happens at 97.5ms-102.5ms, then the preemptRender which should originally be done near 98-100ms can only be done at 105ms, so it calls window.render too late, thus the rasterizer may fail to rasterize the frame before the 116.67ms vsync, so there is a jank. (If needed, I can draw a figure).

However, with this PR, there is no such problem at all. The flutter_smooth will call NotifyIdle immediately *after* each and every preemptRender, with a deadline of roughly 14ms (16.67ms minus a few ms). By doing this, there are two benefits. Firstly, since the heap is not that full, GC can finish its work sooner instead of the 20ms bad case when the heap is really full. This avoids the 20ms-long-GC problem above. Secondly, since we actively tell Dart VM that it can start a GC at *this* time, GC can run for a time duration as long as ~14ms without causing any jank. This is contrary to the discussion above, where even a 5ms GC can cause a frame jank. As for why it can run 14ms without causing trouble, it is because, suppose we start it at 100ms and it runs 14ms, then we are now at 114ms, and we start preemptRender. Since preemptRender is really fast (e.g. 2ms), we will submit window.render at 116ms. In other words, we submit window.render with sufficient time left for rasterizer to finish its job - as long as rasterizer finishes its job before 133.33ms, no jank will happen.

Therefore, the title is explained well: It allows `flutter_smooth` to get 60FPS, even if GC needs to run for 14ms per 16.67ms. (That extreme GC will not happen in real world, I just want to say this proposal works even for that.)

I have already done that for my engine branch and ran experiments on flutter_smooth. It works pretty well - originally I observe GC-caused janks and then they disappear after this fix. If you are interested I can present some data.

As for tests: Have not found a way to add tests for this very simple calling, may need a test exempt.

Tests can actually get to the private classes, they just can't use the private class name. You can cast the render object to `dynamic` and can call things on it blindly.

@Hixie Thanks, but the problem is I cannot *construct* a `_CupertinoDialogRenderWidget` object. All its *current* usages does not cause this bug (but future usages may do), while this *is* a logical bug indeed (since by definition updateRenderObject should update the fields).

@fzyzcjy

If you're alright with it, I'd like to grab the issue from you to wrap it up. We'll need to make some changes internally and do some extra documentation to release this due to the internal test failures. If you'd like, I'll guide you through the extra docs and just handle the internal stuff myself, but I think it'll be easier with just one person working to get this landed.

### Speed up pointer data packet dispatching by roughly 2x when multiple packets come

1. I will finish code details, refine code, add tests, make tests pass, etc, after a code review that thinks the *rough idea* is acceptable. It is because, from my past experience, reviews may request changing a lot. If the general idea is to be changed, all detailed implementation efforts are wasted :)
2. The PR has an already-working counterpart, and it produces ~60FPS smooth experimental results. The benchmark results and detailed analysis is in chapter https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/benchmark/. All the source code is in  https://github.com/fzyzcjy/engine/tree/flutter-smooth and https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter/tree/flutter-smooth.
3. Possibly useful as a context to this PR, there is a whole chapter discussing the internals - how flutter_smooth is implemented. (Link: https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/design/)

---


#### Benefits for Flutter (without considering flutter_smooth)

Multiple pointer data packets often arrive in one vsync interval. Currently, each of them requires a PostTask, C++-to-Dart-call, etc. However, when there is already one *pending* PostTask and a second data packet arrives, we can optimize it - no need to schedule a second PostTask and C++-to-Dart call, but instead utilize the pending PostTask and submit more data inside one call.

How much speed up does it give: Consider the following screenshot (It happens after a long janky frame, but serves pretty well for us to compute numbers because it contains a lot of items - the average measure error will be much smaller). As we can see,

* total wall time: ~8.2ms
* total Dart time (measured by the `_handlePointerDataPacket` time, which is the 4th purple row. I made an extra Timeline event to measure that): ~3.2ms

Therefore, if we merge multiple into one, we can get roughly 2x speed up, because it removes those idle periods between them, as well as some of the big overhead between Engine::DispatchPointerDataPacket and the real Dart code execution.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5236035/196432743-3e1c59b0-29d8-4139-9134-25e361785515.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5236035/196433392-c76ed644-4df1-4d5d-82ab-4eea9ed3a0ed.png)

Concrete cases when this happens:

1. When it janks, this PR helps speed up. For example, many Android devices provide two data packets per vsync interval. So suppose somehow the UI thread took 30ms to compute a frame, then this approach will merge 3-4 packet deliver into one.
2. In some devices, speedup due to this PR happens in each and every time. For example, below is a tracing on a test phone. As you can see, it delivers 4 pointer data packets per frame. Consider what will happen when UI thread needs (e.g.) 15ms to compute (unlike what is in the screenshot which is very lightweight workload indeed). Then, the first 3 out of 4 packets will be able to be merged by this PR.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5236035/196432383-79921b20-791e-4b51-b3a7-14e671bfea41.png)


#### Benefits for flutter_smooth

The analysis is similar to above. However, since there are a lot of big janky frames in flutter_smooth, it is common to see a dozen of pointer event dispatching after that long janky frame. Therefore, this PR makes that part much much faster.

### Make deadline of `NotifyIdle` configurable, allowing `flutter_smooth` to get 60FPS, even if GC needs to run for 14ms per 16.67ms

This PR is similar to https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36797. However, it addresses another portion of the GC-caused-jank problem.

Consider the following case: For each frame, UI thread needs to run for 16.00ms. Then:

**Without this PR and without flutter_smooth**: We know NotifyIdle will be called after the frame ends (more specifically, at AwaitVSync), and the "deadline" argument of NotifyIdle is set to "next_vsync_time - current_time". In other words, it is 16.67-16=0.67ms in our scenario. When DartVM receives this NotifyIdle call, it estimates how long a young GC needs, and realize it needs more than 0.67ms, so it do not call any young GC here. Therefore, garbage starts to accumulate. Finally, at one time, (young) GC must happen because the heap is full. At that time, Dart VM will stop the world for (e.g.) 10ms. Given that the UI thread needs 16.00ms to compute the content of one frame, the 10ms stop-the-world means it must miss at least one deadline. Thus, it janks whenever GC comes.

**With this PR and flutter_smooth**: No such problem at all. Let's consider one specific frame. Suppose the UI thread runs from 0.00-16.00ms and finished computing the content. Then, when calling NotifyIdle, I will deliberately set the "deadline" to be "next_vsync_time - current_time + 14ms". In other words, DartVM is now notified that, it has 14.67ms (instead of 0.67ms as before). Given this loose deadline, Dart VM happily executes a young GC (when it feels needed) using (e.g.) 10ms. Now we are at 26.00ms and the next frame begins. Given that we are using flutter_smooth, we can easily deliver an extra smooth frame when needed near 33.33ms, even though the plain-old frame needs 16.00ms to compute. Therefore, GC is triggered at proper time that does not cause any jank. And since NotifyIdle is triggered per 16.67ms with sufficient deadline (>14ms deadline duration), Dart VM will do GC at these period, so there will be no GC mentioned in the previous case which happens at random location causing UI to jank.

In conslusion, this PR allows `flutter_smooth` to get 60FPS, even if GC needs to run for (e.g.) 14ms per 16.67ms.

### Fix jank and large-jumping frame by controlling rasterizer ending time

It is because, from my past experience, reviews may request changing a lot. If the general idea is to be changed, all detailed implementation efforts are wasted :)

Consider the problem - what will happen, when the computation latency becomes lower temporarily? Looks like it is a good thing, since faster means better; many FPS monitors also do not think this is a problem. Spoiler: It is a bad thing - pay a jank.

Detailed analysis is as follows. To begin with, let us define "latency" as the number of frames it takes from starting drawing frame to ending rasterization. Now, what happens when latency temporarily drops to 1 for one or some frames, while it is 2 in other frames? This is separted to two parts: latency decrease (2->1) and increase (1->2).

The decrease itself does not introduce jank, but causes a uncomfortable "jumping" feeling from the user (will be discussed in the "linearlity" section later). For example, say frame a (0.00-16.67ms) has latency 2, frame b (16.67-33.33ms) has latency 2, and frame c (33.33-50.00ms) has latency 1. Then, at 33.33ms, content of frame a is displayed. However, at 50.00ms, both the content from frame b and frame c wants to be displayed to screen, so frame b will never be shown and only frame c is shown. If it is a linear moving animation with 1px per millisecond, we will see offset being 0 (frame a) at 33.33ms and offset being 33.33px (frame c) at 50.00ms, while we know all other frames will introduce an offset of 16.67px per frame. Thus a big jump happens.

As for the increase (1->2), it will introduce one jank. Suppose frame 0.00-16.67ms has latency 1, and 16.67-33.33ms has latency 2. Then, the rasterizer will provide new content to screen only at 16.67ms and 50.00ms, not at 33.33ms, and there is a jank.

Similar analysis holds for any latency change. For example, "1->2->1" latency change will cause a jank and then a uncomfortable big-jump.

Does this happen in real world? Yes, and quite frequently! I do observe it a lot of times in my tracing timeline. For example, the UI+rasterizer time may be *near* 16.67ms with fluctuation, then we do see a lot of 1->2 / 2->1 latency change. As another example, sometimes a frame may be much faster or slower to compute.

That is what this PR solves. Let's discuss by concrete numbers. Suppose latency is always 2 for a lot of frames, and suddenly in this frame latency drop to 1. Then, this PR will delay the rasterizer ending by sleeping (or can be changed to signaling or whatever you like). It will sleep (shortly speaking) to the next vsync, such that after the sleep, this frame has latency 2. No worries if the sleep happens to be a bit longer - it is still latency 2 if that happens.

### Fix janks caused by await vsync in classical Flutter

1. I will finish code details, refine code, add tests, make tests pass, etc, after a code review that thinks the *rough idea* is acceptable. It is because, from my past experience, reviews may request changing a lot. If the general idea is to be changed, all detailed implementation efforts are wasted :)
2. The PR has an already-working counterpart, and it produces ~60FPS smooth experimental results. The benchmark results and detailed analysis is in chapter https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/benchmark/. All the source code is in  https://github.com/fzyzcjy/engine/tree/flutter-smooth and https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter/tree/flutter-smooth.
3. Possibly useful as a context to this PR, there is a whole chapter discussing the internals - how flutter_smooth is implemented. (Link: https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/design/)

*This fixes the jank happened in **classical** Flutter, even without the existence of flutter_smooth*

*I will add tests and refine code etc after some code review - since review may request changing the code :)*

*This works pretty well in flutter_smooth, see https://github.com/fzyzcjy/engine/blob/flutter-smooth/shell/common/animator.cc for full code.*

During experiments, I observe a phenomenon: Even when the UI thread finishes everything *before* the deadline (vsync) a few milliseconds, the next frame is scheduled *one* vsync later, causing one jank. For example, UI thread may run from 0-15ms, but the next frame starts from 33.33ms instead of the correct 16.67ms.

An example screenshot can be seen at the end of this proposal. I added a timeline event, `Animator::AwaitVSync`, so we can clearly see when vsync await is called. (This screenshot has roughly 3ms space; but more frequently, I see this bug when there is about 0.5-2ms space.)

Therefore, this PR tries to fix this problem. The main idea is that, when detecting we are very near the next vsync, we do not wait at all, but instead directly start the next frame.

### Remove (3N-1) jank and big-jump when N rasterization misses deadline

1. I will finish code details, refine code, add tests, make tests pass, etc, after a code review that thinks the *rough idea* is acceptable. It is because, from my past experience, reviews may request changing a lot. If the general idea is to be changed, all detailed implementation efforts are wasted :)

3. Possibly useful as a context to this PR, there is a whole chapter discussing the internals - how flutter_smooth is implemented. (Link: https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/design/)

---



*This fixes the jank happened in **classical** Flutter, even without the existence of flutter_smooth*

*This PR works with https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36438*

This optimization holds for both classical Flutter and flutter_smooth - indeed the figure below is for classical Flutter.

In experiments, I do see rasterization takes longer time once in a while, instead of having the exact same duration. Experiments show that, a portion of rasterization ends a little bit later than the deadline (the vsync), while all others meet the deadline.

The following figure demonstrates the case. Given that this code change is unrelated to flutter_smooth, the scenario assumes UI is fast and no flutter_smooth exist at all. If using flutter_smooth, things are similar indeed. The first row is the case without code change to `animator.cc`, and the second row is the case with (1) this change (2) plus the https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36837 change.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5236035/197106713-0d90c6e6-918f-4c0f-b005-4a35e460b64c.png)

Consider the frame starting at time 1. In the first row, when the rasterization misses the deadline a little bit (seen in time 2-3), there is nothing new to be shown to the screen, so time 2-3 yields a jank. This is inevitable and also holds for the second row - indeed the only jank in the second row.

Now consider the frame starting at time 2. It yields a big jump in classical Flutter, because the scene "1" (rasterized at about time 3.1) never has a chance to be shown to the screen. The second row does not have the problem because of the deliberate sleep.

Then comes the frame starting at time 3. In classical Flutter, the `Animator::BeginFrame` early returns, and thus no Dart pipeline is run, because it detects the pipeline is full. The pipeline is full because it is occupied with both the frame around 1-3.1 and the frame around 2-3.9. However, we are too pessimisitic about this - even though the pipeline is full at the *beginning* of BeginFrame, it may not be full at the *end* when we really need to call `Animator::Render` and enqueue a real scene to rasterizer. Thus, the classical Flutter (row 1) voluntarily give up a whole frame causing a jank, while the proposed solution runs the normal pipeline and produce a new scene.

Next is the frame starting at time 4, which we again assume its rasterization misses the deadline a little bit. All frames starting at this one indeed mimics the analysis above, so we do not repeate here. The interesting thing is that, the proposed solution *no longer* yields a jank anymore.

So, if we count the numbers, there are 3N janks in the first row (where N is the number of slightly missing deadline), and only 1 jank in the second row.

The drawback is that, the latency is increased by one frame, until the end of current frame chain (such as when animation finally finishes). However, when scrolling or touching, this seems better than having a large annoying jump in the UI - which is directly perceptible by human eyes easily. My test mobile phone has intrinsic (i.e. OS/hardware constraints) touch event latency of about 100ms, so adding 16ms to it looks almost non-distinguishable. Of course, if someone is developing a game, having low latency may be more important.

The same analysis also holds for any "latency changes from 2 to 3 to 2" scenario. For example, the "latency being 3" may last for more than one frame (contrary to the figure), with flutter_smooth.

As a remark, flutter_smooth is indeed implicitly doing something similar when *in the middle of* a plain jank frame. As we know, when a preempt render is about to start (analogy to "when `Animator::BeginFrame` is called"), we never skip it if pipeline is full (analyogy to the code change to BeginFrame). This works well in experiments.

P.S. Indeed, this is not something caused by flutter_smooth (since it is *rasterizer* slowness instead of build/layout slowness), but I have found a way trying to improve it.

This is needed by flutter_smooth in order to handle events. More specifically, when we are in the middle of a long jank frame, flutter_smooth will do preempt render. When doing preempt render, it needs to read and dispatch the pointer events, otherwise the UI will not respond to user fingers at all.

This works together with a few other PRs: https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36438 (to support multi render), https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36837 (which consumes vsync tagret time).

In order to make https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36837 and other Flutter logic work, we need to provide the correct vsync target time. However, currently the fallback target time is filled as the current time, which is surely incorrect and caused bugs for things like https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36837.

Close https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/114002

We all know that, Flutter allows us to create our own `BuildOwner` and `PipelineOwner`, and here is even an official example: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/examples/api/lib/widgets/framework/build_owner.0.dart. The doc also agrees with that. For example:

> You can create other pipeline owners to manage off-screen objects, which can flush their pipelines independently of the on-screen render objects. (https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/PipelineOwner-class.html)

And

> Additional build owners can be built to manage off-screen widget trees. (https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BuildOwner-class.html)

Therefore, theoretically, we should be able to happily use our own `BuildOwner` and `PipelineOwner` anywhere freely. However, it has a bug as follows: If I call `pipelineOwner.flushPaint();` (and sibling methods) *inside* the layout phase of the main PipelineOwner, then I get an assertion error in debug mode.

The root cause is that, even though the self-managed PipelineOwner is isolated from the flutter-managed PipelineOwner, the debug variable `RenderObject.debugActiveLayout` is shared. Therefore, when calling flushPaint on self-manged PipelineOwner within a call of flushLayout of flutter-managed PipelineOwner, the assertions get confused and wrongly throws.

My hack can be seen in https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_smooth/blob/0c5db0ff270aa0c8cff28ea19055999627a8df6d/packages/smooth/lib/src/infra/auxiliary_tree_pack.dart#L214. Copy it here for completeness:

```dart
...
        _temporarilyRemoveDebugActiveLayout(() {
          pipelineOwner.flushPaint();
        });
...

void _temporarilyRemoveDebugActiveLayout(VoidCallback f) {
  // NOTE we have to temporarily remove debugActiveLayout
  // b/c [SecondTreeRootView.paint] is called inside [preemptRender]
  // which is inside main tree's build/layout.
  // thus, if not set it to null we will see error
  // https://github.com/fzyzcjy/yplusplus/issues/5783#issuecomment-1254974511
  // In short, this is b/c [debugActiveLayout] is global variable instead
  // of per-tree variable
  // and also
  // https://github.com/fzyzcjy/yplusplus/issues/5793#issuecomment-1256095858
  final oldDebugActiveLayout = RenderObject.debugActiveLayout;
  RenderObject.debugActiveLayout = null;
  try {
    f();
  } finally {
    RenderObject.debugActiveLayout = oldDebugActiveLayout;
  }
}
```

However, for this to work, the `debugActiveLayout` setter must be public.

The most naive solution is to make it public, but that may violate encapsulation. Thus, in the proposed PR, I create a method to wrap that.

### Expose `Ticker.startTime` so users know the start time and the absolute time

1. I will finish code details, refine code, add tests, make tests pass, etc, after a code review that thinks the *rough idea* is acceptable. It is because, from my past experience, reviews may request changing a lot. If the general idea is to be changed, all detailed implementation efforts are wasted :)
2. The PR has an already-working counterpart, and it produces ~60FPS smooth experimental results. The benchmark results and detailed analysis is in chapter https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/benchmark/.

Currently, the user of `Ticker` only knows the `elapsed` time. However, it looks reasonable to allow the user to know when the ticker thinks it *starts* ticking.

If this does not wanted to be widely used, maybe we can mark it as `@protected` or `@visibleForTesting` or [`@experimental`](https://pub.dev/documentation/meta/latest/meta/experimental-constant.html).

As for where it is needed inside flutter_smooth, it is utilized to know the relative time between a few Tickers as well as the system. In other words, when Ticker A says it elapsed 1 second, flutter_smooth needs to know the startTime such that it knows what "1second" means in absolute time. Detailed code can be seen in https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_smooth/blob/0c5db0ff270aa0c8cff28ea19055999627a8df6d/packages/smooth/lib/src/drop_in/list_view/shift.dart#L352-L356

### Fix bug that`timeDilation` is not reset, causing subsequent test errors, and add verifications to ensure such problem does not exist in the future

Some tests set the time dilation to be non-one, but is not reset after the test ends. Thus, every test after it will see very weird time. I find this bug because got trapped in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/113828.

The added line, `timeDilation = 1.0; // restore time dilation, or it will affect other tests`, is copied from `image_stream_test.dart`'s `'timeDilation affects animation frame timers'` test.

This PR allows the subclasses of `GestureBinding` to read the `hitTest` information. It is directly needed in flutter_smooth, because flutter_smooth has extra call to `dispatchEvent` and only execute those who are in auxiliary tree (and omit those in the main tree) during preempt render. I can copy-and-paste the content of `dispatchEvent` to mimic the behavior, but there is one missing piece: the hitTest information. By adding this PR, it can work.

An alternative solution, which the `flutter-smooth` branch is currently using (but more hacky), may be to add a `filter` to `dispatchEvent`. Then, we can utilize the filter to skip those RenderObjects in the main tree.

This PR depends on the merging of https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36911.

This PR is needed by flutter_smooth, because of the "Brake" mechanism discussed in https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_smooth/blob/feat%2Fdoc-insight/website/docs/design/infra/brake/intro.md (TODO@fzyzcjy: post website link when it is published). In short, for that mechanism to work without jank, a frame must be able to be started immediately instead of waiting for the next vsync (otherwise we must have a jank).

More specifically, let's analyze the figure in the Brake mechanism. The red arrow points where we need this PR. If this PR is not there, the frame cannot start at time=2.6, but have to start at time=3. Then, even though we have preempt render mechanism, we are not able to produce scene and rasterizer quick enough before time=4, so we will have a jank.

### Fix wasted memory caused by debug fields - 16 bytes per object (when adding that should-be-removed field crosses double-word alignment)

Close #113940

## Theoretical analysis

Consider the following example code. Code with "case A" occupies 2.5GB memory, while "case B" is 4.0GB memory.

<details>

```dart
class C {
  int? a;
  int? b;

  // int get computed => a.hashCode; // case A
  int get computed => a.hashCode ^ b.hashCode; // case B
}

Future<void> main() async {
  final arr = <C>[];
  for (var i = 0; i < 100000000; ++i) {
    arr.add(C()
      ..a = 42
      ..b = 100);
  }
  print('hash=${Object.hashAll(arr.map((e) => e.computed))}');

  print('sleep...');
  await Future<void>.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 10000));
}
```

</details>

Therefore, we know that, a field does not occupy memory if there is no read/write to it. For example, the field `b` in case A is never read, so Dart compiler seems so smart that it knows it can be eliminated and no memory is allocated for that. By the way, `b` is *written* even in case A, but seems memory is not allocated as long as it is not read. This agrees with common sense (but since I am not compiler expert, feel free to correct me if I am wrong!).

For fields inside Flutter that is merely used for debug, they are usually accessed inside an `assert(() { ... }());` block. That is great, because if *each and every* field access are inside `assert`, those code will be eliminated in release build, and by discussions above, we will not pay memory for those *debug* fields.

However, `AnimationController.debugLabel` does not seem to follow this. Inside `AnimationController.toStringDetails`, it uses `debugLabel` field *without* being inside a `assert` block. Therefore, IMHO, we will be paying the memory of debugLabel even if we never use that in runtime.

As for why `toStringDetails` is guaranteed to be called, it is simple: `Animation.toString` calls that `toStringDetails`, and we know `toString` will not be tree shaken out.

## Experimental analysis

### Setup

Need to add two dummy fields to AnimationController, such that it crosses the double-word alignment. (Yes, this PR does not affect memory for *today*'s AnimationController, but who can guarantee it never have two more fields or two less fields, which this PR will reduce 16 bytes).

```dart
class AnimationController {
  int? dummy1;
  int? dummy2;
... old code ...
}
```

Use this code

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/scheduler.dart';

void main() => runApp(const MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  State<MyApp> createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  final arr = <AnimationController>[];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    for (var i = 0; i < 2000000; ++i) arr.add(AnimationController(vsync: const TestVSync()));
    print('${arr.first.dummy1} ${arr.first.dummy2}'); // ensure the dummy fields are not removed
    arr.first
      ..duration = const Duration(seconds: 1)
      ..forward();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => Container();
}

class TestVSync implements TickerProvider {
  const TestVSync();

  @override
  Ticker createTicker(TickerCallback onTick) => Ticker(onTick);
}
```

### Operations

1. `flutter build apk --extra-gen-snapshot-options='--print-object-layout-to=object_layout.json'` and look at json to know memory layout
2. `flutter run --profile` to know memory consumption at runtime

### Let `_debugCheckNotUsedAsOldLayer` provide hashcode in addition to runtime type

I see this assert fail when working on my own app today (unrelated to flutter_smooth; work on stable channel). With identity hashcode, we can surely know more about which layer violates.

Its return type is `void`, but doc says "return the engine layer", so I guess the doc is outdated.

### `Layer ... was previously used as oldLayer` assertion error in debug mode, and page being blank in release mode, caused by LeaderLayer addToScene bug

Close https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/113995
Please see the issue for a bug reproduction. Here I will discuss how it is solved and what caused it.

### The real world bug

My app has a part of it not rendered (i.e. page blank) sometimes, which is very weird. After I manage to reproduce it in debug environment, the error is:

<details>

```
======== Exception caught by scheduler library =====================================================
The following assertion was thrown during a scheduler callback:
Layer ClipRectEngineLayer was previously used as oldLayer.
Once a layer is used as oldLayer, it may not be used again. Instead, after calling one of the SceneBuilder.push* methods and passing an oldLayer to it, use the layer returned by the method as oldLayer in subsequent frames.
'dart:ui/compositing.dart':
Failed assertion: line 88 pos 9: '<optimized out>'


Either the assertion indicates an error in the framework itself, or we should provide substantially more information in this error message to help you determine and fix the underlying cause.
In either case, please report this assertion by filing a bug on GitHub:
  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new?template=2_bug.md

### The minimal reproduction

(I will omit how I find out the root cause. If you are interested I can write down.)

Please see https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/113995 with minimal reproduction code

### Why that causes bug

The first pumpWidget creates initial tree, and I deliberately set padding to non-zero, such that LeaderLayer.paint will see non-zero Offset, and thus will pushTransform.

In the second pumpWidget, I deliberately set padding to zero. Then, LeaderLayer.paint will *not* call pushTransform. Correct implementation should set engineLayer to null, but the old code just leave that variable unchanged.

Then comes the third pumpWidget. I change the color inside a RepaintBoundary which is the sibling of LeaderLayer (CompositedTransformTarget). This is carefully constructed (notice the sibling and the RepaintBoundary) to reproduce the following behavior in real-world complicated app: We should (1) ensure `LeaderLayer. _addToSceneWithRetainedRendering` is called, and (2) ensure `LeaderLayer. _needsAddToScene = false`. For example, if we do not add that RepaintBoundary, it will not construct the case, because CompositedTransformTarget's RO will repaint and thus _needsAddToScene becomes true.

Then, interesting thing happens. Look at the code:

```dart
  void _addToSceneWithRetainedRendering(ui.SceneBuilder builder) {
    if (!_needsAddToScene && _engineLayer != null) {
      builder.addRetained(_engineLayer!);
      return;
    }
    ...
```

We have constructed a case, such that the `if` is true. Notice that, if we fix the bug (just as what we do in the PR), the `engineLayer` will be null so if condition will not be true. Thus, buggy code will call `LeaderLayer.addRetained`, while correct code will not.

Then the error happens. Notice that, this `LeaderLayer._engineLayer` indeed is the layer constructed in the second pumpWidget instead of the third (i.e. it is stale from last frame). Therefore, this EngineLayer's children are all from the stale previous frame. For example, the ClipRectLayer from previous frame (second pumpWidget). Since it has already been used as oldLayer in RenderClipRect, that old stale ClipRectLayer should never be used. However we are now using it in addRetained. Therefore, no wonder when `addRetained` is checking all subtree ensuring `_debugCheckNotUsedAsOldLayer`, it fails the assertions.

### Why is the solution valid

With analysis above, we can clearly see this solves the bug. In addition, looking at ClipRectLayer etc, they also have such "engineLayer = null" logic, so even if only mimicking those we should do this.

### Introduce debugWithActiveLayoutCleared to avoid duplicated code

This is indeed a part of https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/113817. However, that one actually does two things in one PR: refactor internal code, and exposes an API. Thus, in order to follow the spirit mentioned in Flutter - one PR for only one thing - I make this refactor a separate PR, which should be easier to review.

### Performance difference

As is discussed in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/113817#issue-1417868505 via compiler explorer, the generate assembly is not worse as long as we use that prefer-inline annotation.

I'm still not quite clear on why this is a solution that should live in the framework.

Tickers have no means of interrupting work more often. Tickers have no special knowledge of when vsync happens. This seems to introduce a number of problems that will be difficult for developers to reason about. I think this could be solved in a package instead.

Hmm why are other env flags in flutter easy to discover, by adding doc or something else? I can do the same, then this is no problem.

As mentioned above, these perf metrics are *already exposed* via the timeline data, such as by looking at GPURasterizer::Draw.

But we need to do profiling to get profile data, don't we :)

Rephrase the problem: We are providing redundant data (i.e. report timing, even if timeline tracing already has the data), and that redundancy is causing measurable speed drop compared with release mode. Then we are biasing the profiling result.

So, if this is not to be merged, maybe we should create another PR to the doc site, with something like: "Please do not believe the speed in profile mode. It will be measureably slower than release mode." But IMHO users will not like that sentence.

Look like I can remove the environment variable.

In Dart, if we have a normal variable that only has one constant value, then the field will be removed. https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/50287#issuecomment-1289027245 "Also AOT compiler is capable of removing unused fields of various kinds (the field is also effectively unused if it always contains the same constant value or is only written into, but never read)."

### Avoid future bugs about wrong manipulation of engineLayer inside addToScene

In https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/113998, I have fixed the bug caused by wrongly using engineLayer. But that bug is so time consuming to locate, so I write this PR to add assertions so we will not add such bugs in the future anymore.

**Question**: In order to insert assertions, I have to wrap the `addToScene` function. IMHO the best thing is `addToScene` vs `performAddToScene` (like `layout` vs `performLayout` so everyone is familiar). However, that is a breaking change. I am not a googler so not sure whether you like it or not?
IMHO the breaking change may be acceptable, because (1) it is merely a rename so simple to migrate (2) very few people write their own Layer class so this will affect few people.
(Currently, I temporarily create a `addToSceneWrapped` method in order to see whether the code works - but I guess this should not be the final name)

This assertion does work, because https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/114124/checks?check_run_id=9132589021 reports the following error, which is exactly the error that #113998 finds and fixes.

```
══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY SCHEDULER LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The following assertion was thrown during a scheduler callback:
When addToScene previously configures the engineLayer, it should either update it in current
addToScene, or set it to null explicitly. Otherwise, Flutter framework may utilize that already
out-of-date engineLayer and thus cause problems. However, it is observed that
previousEngineLayer=TransformEngineLayer#38532153 while engineLayer=TransformEngineLayer#38532153.
This originates in LeaderLayer#204442042.
'package:flutter/src/rendering/layer.dart':
Failed assertion: line 673 pos 9: 'previousEngineLayer == null || previousEngineLayer !=
engineLayer'

Either the assertion indicates an error in the framework itself, or we should provide substantially
more information in this error message to help you determine and fix the underlying cause.
In either case, please report this assertion by filing a bug on GitHub:
  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new?template=2_bug.md

I started to review this, but then realized this seems to be at odds with some similar work that was done for iOS - see `pointer_data_dispatcher.h` and in particular the `SmoothPointerDataDispatcher`.

I think you're on to something here, but I wonder if we should be looking at making the SmoothPointerDataDispatcher work on more than just iOS at this point (as in, perhaps some Android phones are now doing what iOS was doing w.r.t. pointer events and screen vsync being different). This approach does not currently seem to be compatible with that, and I have some concerns about thread safety around it (you're capturing `this` and posting it to a different task runner in an unsafe manner).

I would suggest filing a specific bug for this issue with more details about which platform(s) you're observing this behavior on and how what you need is different from the SmoothPointerDataDispatcher (if it's different at all). If you're on Android, it would probably be worth doing an experiment where the smooth dispatcher is enabled there.

This removes backpressure from the rasterizer and will make the application run hotter than necessary in a lot of cases. It'd be nice to improve things here, but we can't completely remove that backpressure safely.

Same comment as on the linked PR applies.

In particular, it's really hard to reason about how to use this parameter correctly. A lot of the work you're doing seems to be geared towards ignoring/overriding the vsync that the system gives us instead of cooperating with it more. 

In particular, *vsync is an important source of backpressure that we must respect*. We cannot just keep shoving frames at the system compositor, we will overwhelm it and it will start dropping more frames than necessary/run into long GPU stalls. This will be really bad on older hardware, and still be bad on newer hardware.

> @dnfield This method is significantly cheaper than the timeline.

I originally thought so. But interestingly, seems no in a few reasons:

* timeline is usually there (or even cannot be disabled? not find a flag to disable), while report timings is an extra thing
* timeline makes app slower evenly, while report timings is a big burst. thus, flutter_smooth can handle timline slowness very easily (and still gets 60fps and smooth user feeling), while report timings will cause a jank (because it itself takes some long time and during that time flutter_smooth cannot perform any job to submit extra frames).

---

For disable tracing: Not see any flag to disable IMHO

```
flutter run --help | grep trace
    --trace-startup                               Trace application startup, then exit, saving the trace to a file. By default, this will be saved in the "build" directory. If the FLUTTER_TEST_OUTPUTS_DIR environment variable is set, the file will be written there instead.
    --endless-trace-buffer                        Enable tracing to an infinite buffer, instead of a ring buffer. This is useful when recording large traces. To use an endless buffer to record startup traces, combine this with "--trace-startup".
    --trace-systrace                              Enable tracing to the system tracer. This is only useful on platforms where such a tracer is available (Android, iOS, macOS and Fuchsia).
    --trace-skia                                  Enable tracing of Skia code. This is useful when debugging the raster thread (formerly known as the GPU thread). By default, Flutter will not log Skia code, as it introduces significant overhead that may affect recorded performance metrics in a misleading way.
    --[no-]await-first-frame-when-tracing         Whether to wait for the first frame when tracing startup ("--trace-startup"), or just dump the trace as soon as the application is running. The first frame is detected by looking for a Timeline event with the name "Rasterized first useful frame". By default, the widgets library's binding takes care of sending this event.
    --[no-]hot                                    Run with support for hot reloading. Only available for debug mode. Not available with "--trace-startup".
```

Looking at https://github.com/flutter/engine/blob/6368dee0d78f4345e6cfdc4541754acb0891d845/shell/common/pointer_data_dispatcher.h#L157, seems that SmoothPointerDataDispatcher is just delaying *one* packet.

May I know a bit more details?

By the way, this PR does not shoving too many frames. Indeed, it has one and exactly one rasterization ending (i.e. submit data to OS) in each vsync interval. Thus, it behaves exactly the same as a super-smooth app, which also provide one and exactly one data to system per vsync interval.

@dnfield I see your point: If repeatedly call this method, *and at the same time* the whole UI thread pipeline is much faster than 16ms, then we end up running multiple UI thread pipeline  inside one vsync interval. In other words, multi window.render per vsync interval. I admit is a waste - but it is the user who is doing the wrong thing ;) Just like, users can put a ton of Opacity and see rasterizer jank, or they can run sync operations on ui thread and observe ui jank, etc. Nobody can stop them from doing the wrong thing and observe bad outcome.

### How PR solves it

It seems that this is caused by integer rounding. For example, suppose our SnapshotWidget (and thus its Layer) is 9.4 pixels, then after toImageSync will get a 10x10 (or 9x9?) ui.Image instead of a 9.4x9.4 image - since image size must be integer. Then, next time we paint this ui.Image, the original code will paint the 10x10 rectangle area into the 9.4x9.4 Canvas, thus causing resizing of the content. The PR will remember the real size is 9.4 instead of 10, so next time when painting the ui.Image we will paint the 9.4x9.4 rectangle area into the 9.4x9.4 canvas, so no resize of content.

### Refactor usages of `physicalSizeTestValue` to simplify code and improve DX

Just a small refactor. Using:

```dart
  set physicalSizeCurrentTestValue(ui.Size value) {
    physicalSizeTestValue = value;
    addTearDown(clearPhysicalSizeTestValue);
  }
```

We can make setting physical size test values a bit better in the following two aspects:

1. Code is less duplicated. Originally need to specify set value + clear value, now only need one call
2. Writing new tests are less error-prone, especially for new learners of Flutter, thus increasing DX. When I firstly learn Flutter, I often wrongly write down set test value calls, *without* the clear value calls. Then the tests works pretty well when isolated, but you know, it fails weirdly when run sequentially because the later tests have wrong physical size. As a new learner of Flutter (years ago), it took me some time before realizing it is this bug. Thus, it would be great to avoid the possibility of such problem from the beginning.

### Fix error when resetting configurations in tear down phase

(This is WIP, since I want to see whether this change will make regression test fail or not)

Consider this simple example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/scheduler.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('addTearDown should work', (tester) async { // <-- THIS FAILS
    timeDilation = 2;
    addTearDown(() => timeDilation = 1);
  });

  testWidgets('directly reset should work', (tester) async { // <-- this is ok
    timeDilation = 2;
    timeDilation = 1;
  });
}
```

It yields:

<details>

```shell
/Volumes/MyExternal/ExternalRefCode/flutter/bin/flutter --no-color test --machine --start-paused test/a.dart
Testing started at 09:50 ...

══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY FLUTTER TEST FRAMEWORK ╞════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The following assertion was thrown running a test:
The timeDilation was changed and not reset by the test.

When the exception was thrown, this was the stack:
#0      SchedulerBinding.debugAssertNoTimeDilation.<anonymous closure> (package:flutter/src/scheduler/binding.dart:662:9)
#1      SchedulerBinding.debugAssertNoTimeDilation (package:flutter/src/scheduler/binding.dart:665:6)

#3      AutomatedTestWidgetsFlutterBinding._verifyInvariants (package:flutter_test/src/binding.dart:1433:11)
#4      TestWidgetsFlutterBinding._runTestBody (package:flutter_test/src/binding.dart:952:7)
<asynchronous suspension>

The test description was:
  addTearDown should work
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Test failed. See exception logs above.
The test description was: addTearDown should work
```

</details>

In other words, we do not allow resetting configurations in `addTearDown` (or `tearDown`). Instead, we must do it at the end of the closure.

IMHO resetting things in `addTearDown`/`tearDown` is a commonly seen practice. For example, `window.physicalSize` can be reset in a tear-down function, and even Flutter test code inside the framework does so a lot of times. A quick search also shows that, such as [this example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6854658/explain-the-setup-and-teardown-python-methods-used-in-test-cases), resetting in tear down holds even for other tests such as Python.

By disallowing so, Flutter devs may have a bit more friction when learning Flutter, since they may firstly write down code that follows common practice, realizing it does not work, and change it.

It is also inconsistent with other parts of the Flutter. As mentioned above, `window.physicalSize` can be reset in a tear-down function, but things like timeDilation cannot.

The PR can also make code a bit simpler. Originally, whenever writing setup code (e.g. `timeDilation=2`), we must put tear down code at the end of the function, and wrap with a try-finally. But with the PR, it can be put near the setup code, so it is a bit cleaner for code readers. By the way, this is also a bit like the "defer" keyword in go - something like `configure(); defer reset(); other_functions()` will let the reset be executed last.

In some cases, this seems to simplify code a lot. For example, in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/113830#discussion_r1005887028, I have to introduce a weird timeDilation reset that seems to have no pairing timeDilation modification (and cause confusion of readers - even code reviewers). With this PR, the reset will be put to the next line of modification, so it is clear.

You can ignore this failure for now. Google Testing can only run if a Flutter hacker approves your PR. Internally, it says there's no LGTMs, and it marks the status as failed (there's an internal tracking bug for making this status show pending instead of failing)

### Tiny improvement of RouteSettings display

When name is null, originally it prints something like: `RouteSettings("null", null)`. But we know `"null"` looks like a string instead of a real null. So I change to `RouteSettings(null, null)` when that is null.

### Clarify what AnimatedBuilder really speeds up when using `child`

When I was reading AnimatedBuilder doc (when not that familiar w/ Flutter), I wrongly have the following conclusion: Suppose I have the following, and MyWidget constructs a huge tree:

```dart
return AnimatedBuilder(
  builder: () => AnimatedOpacity(child: Padding(padding: ..., child: MyWidget())),
);

vs

return AnimatedBuilder(
  builder: (child) => AnimatedOpacity(child: child),
  child: Padding(padding: ..., child: MyWidget()),
);
```

Then, reading the [doc](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedBuilder-class.html), I think this will be very little performance boost when using this `child`. It is because,

> If your builder function contains a subtree that does not depend on the animation, it's more efficient to build that subtree once instead of rebuilding it on every animation tick.

So I thought: Yes, I do have a subtree (Padding + MyWidget) that does not change, and this trick can make them built once instead of many times. But it is very fast, because it just creates two objects! (Here, I understood the "a subtree" in the doc as the Padding+MyWidget two objects, while in reality we know it should mean the whole subtree that MyWidget and its descedent widgets build.)

Thus, I add a few lines to clarify this. Hope future flutter new learners do not get confused as me!

> Secondly, I think having two similarly named setters, one that cleans up after itself and one that doesn't, is still pretty unintuitive for developers. There is still a lot of potential for making a mistake, say by accidentally setting physicalSizeTestValue instead of physicalSizeCurrentTestValue and expecting it to automatically do clearPhysicalSizeTestValue.

What about renaming it to: physicalSizeTestValue vs physicalSizeTestValueAutoClear? Then nobody can use it by mistake since the latter says "auto clear"

### Fix janks caused by await vsync in classical Flutter (V2)

Previous: https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36911

(Since the previous one is already closed and I have no permission to reopen, I guess I should create a new issue such that it can be put in the review queue)

As @dnfield points out in https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36911#issuecomment-1294089965:

> we need some motivating benchmarks that clearly show what benefits would be gained here, and we need to see that changes to this won't negatively impact existing benchmarks/users.

Thus, reproduction is shown in the section below. As for existing benchmarks, could you please give some hints? I guess I have no permission to execute skia perf as it seems only run on master or other flutter branches. Thus, maybe I can do nothing except for creating a PR and see skia perf after it is merged...

## Reproduction

### Setup and analysis

In the benchmark, I deliberately make a dead loop to mimic the case when ui thread runs for smaller than but very close to 16.67ms. This is quite hacky and may not work on your device, so please modify the hardcoded time in the code if you cannot reproduce it. But hopefully this is ok as a "motivating" benchmark you mentioned :)

I also realize this seems hard to reproduce if the await vsync is called per 16ms. Instead, when I make ui thread deliberately janky (e.g. ~100ms), so that await vsync is not called for ~100ms, this is reproduced. Not sure why, but anyway regardless of why this happens, the PR can solve it.

In the screenshots below, I add red vertical lines manually by mimicking the `VSYNC` interval (this is the correct interval that I have fixed previously, so can use it). As we can see, the AwaitVsync is called *before* the vsync (which is imaginary and not shown in figure), but we miss it for a whole 16.67ms.

### Data

Code: https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter/tree/feat/await-vsync-directly-call + standard engine build (because this is reproduction not bugfix)
Run it: `/path/to/flutter drive --profile -t test_driver/run_app.dart --driver test_driver/near_full_tim_perf_test.dart`

### Remove (3N-1) jank and big-jump when N rasterization misses deadline (V2)

This PR is just a rough sketch. If it looks OK, I will polish (e.g. add tests, refine code etc)

Previous:  https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36912

Background: The original proposal completely removes back-pressure. Thus, suppose a rasterzation takes 1000ms, then we will be running ui thread unnecessarily for 60 times.

Proposed new change: Maybe we should conditionally remove back-pressure. More specifically, when we see PipelineFull, we *only* ignore it and continue running ui thread under the following condition: The current ongoing rasterization has not been running for a long time. This condition holds for the figure in my previous comment, so the main scenario that this PR wants to solve is happy. On the other hand, for the "1000ms-long-rasterization" case, we will only waste one single ui pipeline computation, instead of 60 computations, so the waste does not look like a lot. I agree one waste is indeed waste, but it is the cost to pay (user battery consumes a tiny bit more) if we want to make the UI that user feels completely smooth at 60FPS (which is one of the goals of Flutter IMHO).

Remark: Code comments also describe this as well.

Hmm `NotifyIdle` seems very generic - there seems no VM internals, but only "hey I am idle for a period of time". It is not something like `NotifyDartToDoYoungGC` which is internals :) But instead, it is a well-defined interface so dev can tell flutter it is free.

> Perhaps it would be more appropriate to expose a different API around whether an animation is occurring currently, although I think @iskakaushik has already done some work on that.

Sorry but I do not quite get it. In flutter_smooth (detailed design: https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/design/), a janky frame can last for a long time (for convenience of description, suppose 100ms). Then, during this whole period, the Dart in UI thread will be busy, so it is impossible to execute any C++ code *unless* Dart code explicitly do so. With this PR, flutter_smooth will explictly call notifyIdle with an explicit deadline of ~14ms (much longer than classical Flutter). This is a bit like the pull vs push model problem.

> Same problems as the other NotifyIdle PR - these are details we don't want to expose to users.

Same confusion as in https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36797. Still think "dev tells system it can be idle for a period of time" is not something internal but a reasonable thing.

> NotifyIdle might not do anything, or it might do a lot more than the user expects.

Totally agree - I have checked Dart NotifyIdle source code and saw it uses something like history data to guess how long GC will happen now, but it can run for longer or shorter time.

As for this specific case of GC: If it does not do anything, there is surely no problem. If it do a lot more, it is still no problem. This is because, a much longer execution means that, even if we do not NotifyIdle, GC will happen somewhere in the future with at least this time duration (because garbage only accumulates).

It is also like what we do with `sleep`. Dart (and all lang) have a `sleep` function and can specify how long to sleep. But as you have pointed out earlier, the thread may not be woken up at that time because of OS schedule. In other words, sleep may sleep a lot more than the user expects. Or, even consider this: Each and every line of Dart code (indeed Java/... as well), will have the possibility that, it takes much much longer time to finish! For example, needs 10ms to finish a single `i++`. This is just fact, not something that I make up - because we have the stop-the-world GC. When STW happens, the code just stuck. Furthermore, we know operating systems which Flutter targets schedule threads with preemption. Thus, it is totally possible that any line of code executes much longer than the user expects even if using C/C++/Rust/etc. So, shall we ban `sleep` from users if the same logic holds, or ban any language with GC, or ban any operating system that is not real-time ;) (Surely I am joking!)

> In all honesty, it would be nice to get rid of it entirely since it is hard to reason about and seems to come out wrong very frequently. If users can change this arbitrarily it will make it much harder to reason about what's going on in an application.

Sorry but do not get it.

May I know a bit more details why "wrong very frequently"? IMHO it just "notifies it is idle" and the only way to be wrong is the user forgets it can run for a much longer time - then my discussions about sleep and STW GC holds.

And I also wonder why "much harder to reason about what's going on in an application"? IMHO it is shown in the timeline, so it is quite clear what is going on. And this is indeed a Dart VM specific thing, so it is even not that related to Flutter framework and engine.

I agree, it is overriding the system vsync. However, this is used for flutter_smooth, which *really* has to override some things in the engine...

Does it help if we mark it as `@experimental`? Then we can freely change it in the future without worrying potential users excluding flutter_smooth.

If this API is for normal dev then I totally agree. So same as in the other reply - shall we mark it as "not suitable for normal dev" and mainly for flutter_smooth (and others who knows deeply about flutter)?

> The direction of this information has to go in the opposite direction: we need to improve or make it easier for developers to understand the target vsync time and how much time they have left to do work rather than letting developers tell the system what they think vsync should be.

That's perfect for the standard flutter, but IMHO may be impossible for flutter_smooth (e.g. https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/design/infra/preempt/idea). In flutter_smooth, there are just tons of long janky frame (e.g. say one frame takes 100ms), and flutter_smooth trigger a lot of *extra* window.render.

Related: https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36438 - one onBeginFrame with multiple window.render.

In flutter_smooth, one janky frame can be (e.g.) 100ms, and we need to submit window.render per vsync interval. When is the next vsync interval? This question is answered by this PR.

In other words, in the 100ms janky frame, onBeginFrame only provides first vsync target time, while we need to know the rest.

Tickers have no means of interrupting work more often. Tickers have no special knowledge of when vsync happens. This seems to introduce a number of problems that will be difficult for developers to reason about. I think this could be solved in a package instead. 

Totally agree. However, I cannot find out a method to let it live in a package while making flutter_smooth implementable. flutter_smooth need to support AnimationController and everything built on it (CircularProgressIndicator, SlideTransition, ...), so it seems impossible to create a 3rd party package. Otherwise, at least users cannot use *any* builtin widget such as CircularProgressIndicator and higher-level widgets, as long as a widget directly or indirectly depends on AnimationController/TickerProviderMixin. Users also cannot use most of the other 3rd party packages, because they use Flutter's AnimationController/TickerProviderMixin as well.

Part of the work to make this benchmark would be coming up with an at least somewhat realistic case where UI thread work goes to _just_ over vsync budget. Yes, you can construct a benchmark that does exactly that, but what's an example of a real application that actually behaves that way on a real device? IME, it's more common to see an application that _far_ exceeds budget on some frames and then is under budget on many other frames, rather than one that is consistently just _slightly_ over budget. In fact, if you had one that was consistently over budget, you should instead look to optimize your consistent workload to be less - it's an application problem rather than an engine one. But right now, we don't have good ways to fix the problem where some frames over budget _despite_ the fact that you're not doing anything all that unreasonble - for example, oyu're showing a screen full of text that can't all do its initial layout within frame budget on your target device.

No, conditionally removing back-pressure is still bad: it will cause other problems for sure, since we're conditionally letting the CPU get ahead of the GPU. It'll just be harder to figure out when that's happening and fix it.

IME, it's more common to see an application that far exceeds budget on some frames and then is under budget on many other frames, rather than one that is consistently just slightly over budget.

IMHO it is more like a math/statistics problem than a programming problem. Using my observation from previous issue (this problem happens as long as 2ms before deadline), and a vsync interval is 16.67ms. Then, for a very rough estimation, suppose the real time used is uniform from shortest time to longest time possible - this is very rough, but it somehow makes sense because an app targets from highest-end to lowest-end devices. Then, we have 2/16.67 = 12% probability. Surely that does not sound huge, but it does happen and affect user feeling. Indeed, my flutter_smooth's goal is 60FPS (on 60FPS machine) and this single problem drops 7.2FPS if using the above very rough analysis - and in reality I roughly see more drops.

So, answering "it's more common to see..." - surely yes, but Flutter is a high-performance framework and wants to be 60FPS, instead of a framework that allows jank from time to time ;)

>  In fact, if you had one that was consistently over budget, you should instead look to optimize your consistent workload to be less - it's an application problem rather than an engine one

By the way, this bug is not only about "over budget" - if ui thread runs over 16.67ms (on 60hz machine) one can never get 60FPS (but can still be 60FPS with flutter_smooth - that's another story). In addition, a frame that is computed quicker than 16.67ms in one phone may be slower than 16.67ms on another lower end phone.

> But right now, we don't have good ways to fix the problem where some frames over budget despite the fact that you're not doing anything all that unreasonble - for example, oyu're showing a screen full of text that can't all do its initial layout within frame budget on your target device.

Indeed we have - flutter_smooth :) That example is indeed the first example that I have solved when prototyping (btw thanks for providing that example as a canonical test base!).

I like the goal of this (easier tests, less likely to make mistakes), but I have a couple of concerns with this as implemented:

1. Does this _hide_ a problem, rather than addressing it?
    * It's pretty common that `addTearDown` and `tearDown` calls are missed as you pointed out in your description. This PR makes it easier to not miss those calls for a few specific cases, but it doesn't really address _why_ those calls are missed or drive users to write better tests in other cases.
2. Does adding these methods here set a standard that the testing framework will be expected to stick to elsewhere?
    * How do we determine which properties or fields should/shouldn't have versions that auto clear?
    * How should adding those auto clear versions be prioritized?
    * If/when those versions break, should it be considered a breaking change and should the breaking change process be followed for just the auto clear version, or for auto clear and standard versions?
3. Will this cause unintuitive behavior in other use cases?
    * Specifically I'm thinking of someone trying to use this for setting up a `group` of tests. Since this makes use of `addTearDown`, it'll only behave as expected for individual tests. If someone tries to use the "AutoClear" version in a group, it'll throw an exception.
    * In combination with number 2, would any "AutoClear" versions also need an "AutoClearGroup" version?

Personally, I'd lean towards pushing the convenience method part to a separate package where the expectations for support, maintenance, and coverage won't be as high. It'd also allow for more community contributions for different conveniences and extensions to be added without needing to go through as much process as this repo requires. As for the fixes to our own tests, it's a great catch and should be included, but IMO without using the convenience method.

It's pretty common that addTearDown and tearDown calls are missed as you pointed out in your description. This PR makes it easier to not miss those calls for a few specific cases, but it doesn't really address why those calls are missed or drive users to write better tests in other cases.

So what do you think is the reason "why those calls are missed"? I indeed am not sure - maybe because they just forget?

How do we determine which properties or fields should/shouldn't have versions that auto clear?

For fields that have a `set somethingTestValue` and `clearSomethingTestValue` I guess?

> How should adding those auto clear versions be prioritized?

IMHO this is quite trivial to implement (if you like I can submit more)

> If/when those versions break, should it be considered a breaking change and should the breaking change process be followed for just the auto clear version, or for auto clear and standard versions?

Sorry, not sure about the question

> Will this cause unintuitive behavior in other use cases?
Specifically I'm thinking of someone trying to use this for setting up a group of tests. Since this makes use of addTearDown, it'll only behave as expected for individual tests. If someone tries to use the "AutoClear" version in a group, it'll throw an exception.
In combination with number 2, would any "AutoClear" versions also need an "AutoClearGroup" version?

Luckily, not a problem! If you like I can put the following code which automatically uses addTearDown vs tearDown and is used internally in my app:

```dart
void autoSetUpTearDownOrAddTearDownSync(
  void Function() setUpBody,
  void Function() tearDownBody,
) {
  // ref: test_api :: test_structure.dart :: addTearDown
  // `Invoker.current==null` will lead to a message `addTearDown() may only be called within a test.`
  // so use this to determine whether in test
  if (Invoker.current == null) {
    setUp(setUpBody);
    tearDown(tearDownBody);
  } else {
    setUpBody();
    addTearDown(tearDownBody);
  }
}
```

@fzyzcjy

Personally, I think those calls are missed because they aren't made obvious to users through documentation and examples.  As such, I'm not sure hiding those calls behind convenience methods promotes better usage of those methods.

Adding the convenience methods _also_ increases our API surface, which increases our maintenance burden, and sets up expectations for other parts of the testing framework that don't actually _solve_ the problem of those methods being missed, but instead makes it even less likely that users will run into an example using them correctly.

Long story short, I don't think the convenience methods are worth the long term cost of introducing that pattern to the framework. Hence suggesting creating a package for them, where the maintenance costs and coverage expectations are going to be lower.

It's also worth noting that there's work at the moment to move from a single window to multiple views (to support desktop better), which may be a great opportunity to improve on these particular fields' APIs from the ground up. I believe @goderbauer is driving that initiative, though he's out until next Tuesday.

Not sure how other people do, but I am not this case personally. I have this simply because I forgot to call the clear :/ I do vaguely remember the clear, and if you test me in a questionaire I will remember it, but when programming I just set the value - doing the minimal necessary work - while forgetting the clear.

Then what should we do for the flutter framework itself? Or shall we mark them `@internal` so flutter framework can use it?

If the convenience methods are moved to a package, I would suggest just not using them in the flutter repo and updating the tests here to use the `addTearDown` methods where appropriate to clear the values. That way, those tests can serve as an example of how to use the standard `addTearDown` pattern.

I mean, if you want to get the tests _really_ DRY, then the setup/teardown would be moved out to the `group` level and done either once for the entire group, or set up to happen before and after each test with the group level methods.

Since we're working on a public API though, we don't necessarily _want_ to be DRY on everything. We have to balance trying to keep our internal stuff as clean as we can with not making the API too specific to our internal use cases.

Well, those tests are not in the same file, so IMHO they cannot be solved by `group`.

I see. Btw, it is not "too specific to our internal use cases" as it is used everyday by external users

The purpose of GPU backpressure is to help make sure we don't end up outrunning the GPU on the CPU, which will lead to jank because the GPU can't give us buffers fast enough. We've had issues with this for example even when we tried to use extensions on Android wher it would tell the GPU to drop all but the latest buffer submitted per vsync (led to jittering sometimes which looked worse/as bad as jank).

A bit confused... Let's say GPU is super janky and takes 100ms + CPU outrunning it and compute 6 scenes (though my proposal will not be this bad). Then, IMHO the main problem is CPU  waste battery, because the scene is thrown away. However, seems that the jank will be exactly the same, no matter whether CPU computes 6 scenes or 0 scenes, because the bottleneck is GPU?

The problem is more like: the GPU has 3 or 4 buffers to work with. If you keep asking it to give you buffers to fill when it's busy with them, you're taking time from it doing the work it needs to do to show pixels on the screen, and because you're distracting it from the work it needs to be doing now you're making everything worse for subsequent frames (until you finally stop and let it finish its work queue).

So you could write a program that just continually asks the GPU to hand you a buffer to draw into, but you'll overwhelm the GPU and won't be able to draw as many frames. The solution is to listen to vsync and do your best to only ask for/submit a buffer once per vsync.

May I know where the code in flutter does this? Is it happened during the rasterization, or happen when ui thread creates a scene tree? (I guess former?)

my reasoning is: in this pr, what I did is, BeginFrame will run ui thread pipeline, even if it sees rasterizer queue is full. when ui thread finishes the pipeline, it calls window.render thus Animator::Render. then, if rasterizer queue is still full, it will drop the Scene (ensured by pipeline.h implementation); if not full, it will enqueue the Scene. Thus, IMHO from rasterizer's eyes it is not different.

The other thing to consider with that is what happens when you succeed: does the new frame that gets added to the pipeline look like it "fits" well with the previous and next frames, or does it get rendered in an unexpected vsync and end up looking slightly off/jittery

That draws something like a contacts list. On a low end Android device, building that scene can easily take 27-30ms, mostly in text layout

I've yet to see a full, runnable solution that solves it though. My recollection (which may be wrong) is that the proposals tended to have a lot of comments like "fix this later"

I am not convinced that it is actually the same.  And even if it is the same problem, it would need to be adopted pretty widely before we could land changes to the engine that only make sense if you're using it.

(forget to reply this) It looks well IMHO. But if you are having a rasterization that is longer than 16ms, then it is inevitable to have one jank feeling. see the main figure of PR for more details. And, as for flutter_smooth (note: the PR also holds for classical flutter), an extra doc page: https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/benchmark/analyze/linearity/ (I made up a term called linearity, which is what you mention as jittery I guess)

So I said that a patch you opened in the engine will fail to help some common sources of jank and actually potentially make them worse on low end devices. If I understand, you're saying those common sources go away with flutter_smooth so that's not a problem, and you're moving on to other sources of jank once you solve those common problems.

so I guess the main priority is like this: 
1. maybe we can firstly PR for a partial-flutter_smooth, i.e. a version for only maybe 50FPS not 60FPS (because all those edge cases are not solved). then the PR merged into flutter, and people can try it. then, if many people find it quite helpful etc, maybe we can consider the rest prs or integrate into framework?
2. or alternatively, shall we just consider integrating flutter_smooth to framework now? so many PRs that solely wants to make flutter expose some low-level things are never a  problem now
