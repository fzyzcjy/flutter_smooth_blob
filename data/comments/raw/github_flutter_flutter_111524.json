In addition, when we are talking about the word \"offstage\", we may need to refer to both pages, because they have slightly different meanings.\r\n\r\nThis origins partially from https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/111479#issuecomment-1245534877. Indeed, when talking about \"offstage widgets\", I quickly remembered and opened Offstage page, but never realize there is another page about debugVisitOnstageChildren, which even has a bit different explanation from Offstage. This PR fixes this problem.\r\n\r\n*List which issues are fixed by this PR.
