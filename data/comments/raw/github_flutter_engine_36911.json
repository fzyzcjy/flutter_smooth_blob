I will finish code details, refine code, add tests, make tests pass, etc, after a code review that thinks the *rough idea* is acceptable. It is because, from my past experience, reviews may request changing a lot. If the general idea is to be changed, all detailed implementation efforts are wasted :)\r\n2. The PR has an already-working counterpart, and it produces ~60FPS smooth experimental results. The benchmark results and detailed analysis is in chapter https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/benchmark/. All the source code is in  https://github.com/fzyzcjy/engine/tree/flutter-smooth and https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter/tree/flutter-smooth.\r\n3. Possibly useful as a context to this PR, there is a whole chapter discussing the internals - how flutter_smooth is implemented. (Link: https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/design/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n*This fixes the jank happened in **classical** Flutter, even without the existence of flutter_smooth*\r\n\r\n*I will add tests and refine code etc after some code review - since review may request changing the code :)*\r\n\r\n*This works pretty well in flutter_smooth, see https://github.com/fzyzcjy/engine/blob/flutter-smooth/shell/common/animator.cc for full code.*\r\n\r\nDuring experiments, I observe a phenomenon: Even when the UI thread finishes everything *before* the deadline (vsync) a few milliseconds, the next frame is scheduled *one* vsync later, causing one jank. For example, UI thread may run from 0-15ms, but the next frame starts from 33.33ms instead of the correct 16.67ms.\r\n\r\nAn example screenshot can be seen at the end of this proposal. I added a timeline event, `Animator::AwaitVSync`, so we can clearly see when vsync await is called. (This screenshot has roughly 3ms space; but more frequently, I see this bug when there is about 0.5-2ms space.)\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR tries to fix this problem. The main idea is that, when detecting we are very near the next vsync, we do not wait at all, but instead directly start the next frame.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5236035/197105732-7c0bfbad-8816-46c0-85b1-5007d0f82d5d.png)\r\n\r\nzoom in:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5236035/197105742-c511137c-3089-4ff9-b102-52bdfcfc72f9.png)\r\n\r\nfurther zoom in:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5236035/197105754-fd471b8f-1ae7-45cb-b4d8-3163beb0d87a.png)\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities.\r\n- [x] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide] and the [C++, Objective-C, Java style guides].\r\n- [x] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.\r\n- [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making or feature I am adding, or Hixie said the PR is test-exempt.
