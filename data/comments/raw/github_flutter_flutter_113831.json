It is directly needed in flutter_smooth, because flutter_smooth has extra call to `dispatchEvent` and only execute those who are in auxiliary tree (and omit those in the main tree) during preempt render. I can copy-and-paste the content of `dispatchEvent` to mimic the behavior, but there is one missing piece: the hitTest information. By adding this PR, it can work.\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution, which the `flutter-smooth` branch is currently using (but more hacky), may be to add a `filter` to `dispatchEvent`. Then, we can utilize the filter to skip those RenderObjects in the main tree.\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities.\r\n- [x] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide], including [Features we expect every widget to implement].\r\n- [x] I signed the [CLA].\r\n- [x] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.\r\n- [x] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`).\r\n- [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making, or this PR is [test-exempt]. -- see above\r\n- [x] All existing and new tests are passing.\r\n\r\nIf you need help, consider asking for advice on the #hackers-new channel on [Discord].\r\n\r\n<!-- Links -->\r\n[Contributor Guide]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#overview\r\n[Tree Hygiene]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene\r\n[test-exempt]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#tests\r\n[Flutter Style Guide]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo\r\n[Features we expect every widget to implement]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo#features-we-expect-every-widget-to-implement\r\n[CLA]: https://cla.developers.google.com/\r\n[flutter/tests]: https://github.com/flutter/tests\r\n[breaking change policy]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#handling-breaking-changes\r\n[Discord]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Chat\r\n", "comments": [{"id": "IC_kwDOAeUeuM5MtGhQ", "author": {"login": "flutter-dashboard"}, "authorAssociation": "NONE", "body": "It looks like this pull request may not have tests.
