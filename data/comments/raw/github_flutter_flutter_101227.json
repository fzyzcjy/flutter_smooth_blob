On low-end android phones, opening a page containing complex `Path`s and images.\r\nAnyway, that sounds inevitable, since my app really needs complex images and CustomPainters.\r\n\r\n> \"if my app is junky implementing an algoritm meant for an entirely different framework will fix the issue\"\r\n\r\nWell that is not my assumption. The main idea is not about \"my app is junky\", but \"the React Fiber seems so promising and should address the jank problem for a large portion of cases\".",

Well maybe firstly have a look at the React Fiber? From my understanding, Fiber is an algorithm as follows (using Flutter terms): Sometimes your build/layout/paint may be too heavy to be done within 16ms, so the user will feel jank (e.g. when entering a complex page or adding complex scenario). Then, with Fiber, it splits the work into multiple frames. For example, say you have 3 complex widgets on your page. Then maybe the first frame it just renders/updates the first complex widget and left a placeholder/old state for the rest two, and for the next frame it deals with the second, etc. Then the user will feel the app is smooth as their touching events / animations are 60fps.",

In the meanwhile, all other widgets will run one layout/paint across multiple frames with suspending just like what Fiber does. In other words, when vsync comes, CircularProgressIndicator will do all the layout/paint job, while other widgets will continue working on its layout/paint but will pause once it is near 16ms. Then, we can see CircularProgressIndicator smooth at 60fps, while other widgets having similar rendering speed as before.\r\n\r\nBtw, some side remarks that is less like Fiber: Here is a tool that defers Widgets from being built https://github.com/LianjiaTech/keframe. But I guess we can make it more fine-grained and with more improvements since we are going to modify the flutter framework itself. For example, (very rough draft idea), can we modify the layout phase (or paint, or others), such that it pauses layouting the remainder (and will do it in the next frame), and let painting and other phases go first?",

Animations are in perfect 60fps, since low-priority job auto pause when near timeout. If we use keframe or similar solution, and give too many widgets in one frame, our animation will stuck.\r\n2. No cpu cycles are wasted, because we will never early-pause but will only pause when near timeout. For example, suppose widget A needs 160ms to build+layout+paint+raster, then it will be done in (roughly) 10 frames. If we use keframe or similar solution, and give too little widgets in one frame, we are wasting cpu cycles.\r\n3. It avoids our need to measure, or guess, the time needed for a widget in build/layout/paint/raster phase. Just as I mentioned above, I personally find it hard to guess how long a widget will need in those phases, especially raster phase which is C++ and varies greatly on different CPU/GPUs (different phones).\r\n4. It is OK to have a non-separable widget that is heavy in one phase.\r\n5. It is automatic and declarative.

        "body": "More thoughts here.\r\n\r\n#### 1. For CircularProgressIndicator, or high-priority widgets without low-priority children\r\n\r\nA very draft idea:\r\n\r\nWe may have multiple sub-trees, i.e. have a forest, in flutter. In this example, CircularProgressIndicator may be subtree 1, and everything else may be subtree 2. The subtree 1 goes through build/layout/paint/raster etc for each frame, and subtree 2 may go slowly, i.e. suspend.\r\n\r\nSuppose it needs 10 frames for subtree 2 to finish the whole build/layout/paint/raster process. Then, we just allow all inconsistent and dirty states to exist during that 10 frames. For example, a node may have several layouted children and several un-layouted children. Same goes for rasterizing etc. We also need to ensure nobody can mutate the state accidentally when they are dirty.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I think we may not need to add this suspend feature to the `build` phase, but only add to layout/paint/raster if possible, contrary to React. This is because, if the time-consuming operation is only at build phase, keframe or similar solutions should already work. It may be deep in the rendering pipeline that makes this proposed method more interesting.\r\n\r\nSurely this is just a draft and brainstorm, and I am willing to hear any thoughts!\r\n\r\n#### 2. For ListView scrolling problem, or high-priority widgets with low-priority children\r\n\r\nThe problem is, those big low-priority children may need a lot of frames (say 10 frames) to build/layout/paint/rasterize, and during those 10 frames, their internal data structure are not ready for use. For example, we cannot let it to paint at 5th frame, because its layout tree (or layer tree or something like that) may have a child that has been layouted and another child that has not yet been layouted.\r\n\r\nHowever, we are doing nothing but scrolling. Then what about simply *raster cache* the screen, and scrolling is nothing but shifting this `ui.Image`. More details can mimic this PR: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/106621 In that PR, during a \"zoom page transition\", no real widgets are built in each frame. Instead, a `ui.Image` snapshot is taken in the first frame, and during the whole transition we are just zooming that Image. Our solution is different from #106621, though. In that PR, no work is done during the whole page transition, but in our case, we can perform useful build/layout/paint/raster in the remaining time of each frame.\r\n\r\nThis solution also has some spirit similar to React Fiber: In Fiber, our JS-driven DOM elements are freezed indeed, and it is the CSS animation that still works. In our case, the \"scrolling ui.Image\" is a bit mimic a scrolling CSS animation.",

We just blindly run whatever should be done next, and suspend when we are near 16ms.\r\n\r\nWe do need to let the the high priority job (say CircularProgressIndicator or ListView-scrolling) finish within the totally 16ms though.\r\n\r\nMy first thought is that, it would be best if we execute *all phases* of *this subtree* first, and then execute (and suspend when timeout) all phases of the second subtree in whatever time remain. Then we never need to get the cost.\r\n\r\nIf that is impossible, I wonder whether we can use some heuristics. We all know a CircularProgressIndicator should be very lightweight, so is a ListView-scrolling (if using the ui.Image approach above). We may also learn from the history.",

        "body": "#### More about \"how to build suspendable/interruptable\", given that sync generators are slow\r\n\r\nIs it possible we create a `RenderSuspendable` RenderObject (and corresponding Suspendable widget) which does the following:\r\n\r\n1. Users need to insert this widget into tree whenever they want suspendable. This may be reasonable given this spirit is similar to RepaintBoundary. And users will not need to insert too much, just insert at coarse subtrees. \r\n2. It behaves like a most naive proxy render box in normal cases.\r\n3. When time is near used up, and when RenderSuspendable.layout is called, it will *not* call child.layout, but instead set a flag (say `needsLayoutLaterWhenPossible`) and directly return. As for the return value, it may return the last layout size or user-defined default size (similar to what keframe does in widget-build level). By doing this, ancestor render objects will be happy and finish its layout function very fast.\r\n4. For a `RenderSuspendable` with `needsLayoutLaterWhenPossible=true`, when a new frame comes in, it will `this.markNeedsLayout()`, and thus get a chance to execute its `layout` method again in this new frame. If time is enough, it is done normally as in \"2.\", and the needsLayoutLaterWhenPossible is cleared; otherwise, it is done as in \"3.\".\r\n\r\nRemark: May need a tweak a bit about `layout`'s caching mechanism.\r\n\r\nRemark: RenderSuspendable's sub-tree will *not* be redundantly layouted more than once. For example, say we have a `Column` with two `Suspendable` children, the first one has done layout, and the second one does not because of timeout. Then, when the next frame comes, Suspendable 2 calls markNeedsLayout, and Column starts performLayout. Then Suspendable 1 *does* have layout() called. However, we should recognize it (possibly flutter caching already does so?), and no need to layout its child at all.\r\n\r\n**Features**\r\n\r\n* Solves the problem of \"how to build suspendable/interruptable\", without sync generators\r\n* No need to modify existing render objects, only need to add a new one\r\n\r\n**Potential problem**\r\n\r\nUnnecessary (i.e. redundant) relayout will happen for ancestors of Suspendable, until meeting a relayout-boundary.\r\n\r\nNot sure how large the penalty is. If we can give near enough relayout boundary, looks like it is no problem? In addition, if we wrap *all* expensive subtrees into Suspendables, then the rest may be quite cheap.\r\n\r\n**How is layout / paint / rasterize related?**\r\n\r\nDone one by one. Layout of *everything* will be firstly finished. Only after that, we start doing painting of everything. And then rasterizing.\r\n\r\n**What about paint tree? layer tree? engine(c++) rasterizer?**\r\n\r\nTBD, I guess will be similar to above. Looking forward to hearing some feedbacks about the approach for layout first!",

Let it keep the old content available until the new content is *fully* available.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we may be able to solve it without big modifications to engine. We may just \"take a screenshot\" before starting the journey of heavy updating. For example, suppose we need 10 frames to fully build/layout/paint/rasterize this widget subtree. Then, we use the new `toImageSync()` to take a photo of it. Then, during the 10 frames, we can do anything to the render/layer/engineLayer trees, and whenever the parents let us to paint, we just canvas.drawImage() using that. After 10 frames when we are done, we will finally paint the new thing.\r\n\r\nBy the way, this also has a bonus about *predictable time consumption*. IMHO, the time of drawing (paint+rasterize+...) a `ui.Image` may be easily computed, given it is nothing but a rasterized image.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@dnfield Given that you implemented this great new `toImageSync` feature (https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/33736), I have a question about its performance: \r\n\r\nIn the solution above, instead of painting normally, we may have to convert child into `ui.Image` for each and every `paint` call.\r\n\r\nIn other words, in pseudo code:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nclass OurRenderObject {\r\n  void paint() {\r\n    // child.paint(); // cannot do this\r\n\r\n    if (everything_is_not_dirty) {\r\n      image = toImageSync(child_render_tree); // save a screenshot\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // ...do some expensive work here if time is sufficient...\r\n\r\n    canvas.drawImage(image);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, will this have performance penalty or not?",

(The build phase is wrapped inside layout phase by adding a LayoutBuilder.) Indeed, it does not suspend the paint or raster phase, which should be done in future work.\r\n* It paints nothing (i.e. do not call child.paint) if a Suspendable is suspending. This will destroy the layer tree and C++ engine layer trees, making performance much worse. We should address this problem later, possibly by keeping the layer tree not used but not removed.\r\n* It lets the whole ancestors (up until relayout-boundary) to relayout in each frame.\r\n* Overhead will become non-neglectable, if we want it to run in 60fps. In other words, if we want each frame to be under 16ms, looks like we will only have <10ms for handling the suspendable widgets (rough estimate, but anyway numbers differ on different phones). Then, the price of 60fps smooth animation is that, the suspendable needs longer time to be loaded.\r\n* The current implementation does not run suspendable layouts *last*. Instead, they are run inside non-suspendable layout. Thus, we have to set a \"earlier\" deadline (e.g. 12ms, instead of 16.6ms in the example above), and hope that the remaining job will finish quick enough.\r\n* [Element.performLayout](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderSliverScrollingPersistentHeader/performLayout.html) says, \"In implementing this function, you must call layout on each of your children\". But, when implementing Suspendable, we have to violate this. We will face troubles, or just minor changes are enough?\r\n* If a child under Suspendable mark itself as needed to relayout/rebuild, and there is relayout boundary between that child and Suspendable, then the suspending mechanism will not work at all.\r\n* Originally all code (implicitly) assume that, when a frame ends, build/didUpdateWidget has been called. But now this no longer holds. That will make a ton of widget fail to work, including those inside flutter framework, and many external packages. For example, those who assume this inside their addPostFrameCallback.\r\n* The demo does not yet provide any animations (e.g. a CircularProgressIndicator), so by merely looking at the screen, we cannot see it becomes much smoother ;)",

        "body": "### New idea: Dual isolates\r\n\r\n(This comment is updated)\r\n\r\n#### Advantages\r\n\r\nThe main goal is similar: No matter how heavy your widget build/layout/... is, animations/gestures should be 60fps.\r\n\r\nIt does not require existing Flutter/Dart code to accept new assumptions. For example, in the old proposal, the `layout` may *not* be called within a frame, and thus `build` will also not be called. This may violate many existing code. For example, `addPostFrameCallback` may assume build is done when post-frame.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the \"Dual isolates\" solution will not have those assumptions at all. It seems **not to break existing explicit or implicit assumptions about the code**. Except that it will make Dart isolate \"freeze\" once in a while - but that should not be a problem, since we are all happy with stop-the-world GC and OS's suspending a thread.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it should have much lower overhead, indeed almost zero. No wasted build/layout happens (unlike RenderSuspendable approach). No unnecessary tree destory and recreate happens.\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n\r\nThe approach above, with the minimal sample in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101227#issuecomment-1248894781, has many known problems which I am not sure whether can all be overcome. I will probably also experiment further on that path as well. At the same time, I find out a new approach without most problems above.\r\n\r\nI am not an expert in `flutter/engine`, so please correct me if I am wrong!\r\n\r\n#### Design\r\n\r\nOriginally, IMHO we have a UI thread, which runs both C++ code and Dart main isolate code. Now, we have three (but no worries, they will not be parallel most of the time!):\r\n\r\n* C++ UI thread.\r\n* Dart main isolate: Run everything you know, i.e. the heavy build/layout/paint/.... Say it takes 2 frames to finish.\r\n* Dart sidecar isolate: Run CircularProgressIndicator, or ShiftTheChild(for scrolling ListView, to be explained below).\r\n\r\nAn UML diagram is attached below (best read with text explanations here).\r\n\r\nHere is what happens when a vsync comes in:\r\n\r\n* C++ ui thread receives the vsync. In the old days, it will call dart's DrawFrame. But now, it will set up a timer for a bit less than ~16.67ms (say 15ms), pause self thread, and call Dart main isolate's DrawFrame.\r\n* Dart main isolate's DrawFrame starts running. It runs build/layout happily.\r\n* At 15ms, timer wakes up C++ ui thread. C++ ui thread then immediately \"pause\" the dart main isolate. This is done by \"safepoints\". In other words, we insert `safepoint()` call to `layout()` function of Dart RenderObjects. And that function is a native function reading, say, a mutex lock. When C++ ui thread wants to pause the dart main isolate, it simply acquire the mutex. When Dart goes to the next safepoint() call, it will simply be pause there forever waiting to acquire the mutex (until next frame indeed).\r\n* C++ ui thread calls sidecar isolate to compute the whole build/layout/paint procedure. This is done serially now for simplicity, but should be easily parallizable with some locks.\r\n* Sidecar Dart code is a bit different from the traditional widget/renderobject/layers. Instead, it knows which EngineLayer it owns, and only mutates it. For example, for a CircularProgressIndicator in sidecar, it will know it owns a DisplayListLayer, and only modify pictures in it, without touching other layers. For a ShiftTheChild, it owns a OffsetLayer and modifies its offset.\r\n* Now go back to our C++ ui thread. We will simply utilize the current engine layer tree in C++, and the rest is the same, such as giving data to rasterizer thread and render to the screen.\r\n\r\nThis is not the end of story - notice our main isolate is still computing some layout and is hanging. Now suppose 2nd vsync comes in.\r\n\r\n* Again, C++ ui thread receives vsync. It notices there is still remaining job in main isolate. Then it just resume the main isolate, without telling it anything about the second frame. Thus, in the eyes of main isolate, it will think the whole phone just \"freezed\" for a few milliseconds without other problems, and will happily continue build/layout/etc.\r\n* Suppose the heavy job of the main isolate is finally finished in this frame. Then, it will do painting. In other words, it will mutate the Layer tree in C++ code. We deliberately put no safepoint() during painting, so the C++ layer tree will either be non-mutated or fully-mutated without intermediate case.\r\n* The rest is similar to the first frame, except that our engine layer tree is updated to the new one.\r\n\r\n#### Further improvements\r\n\r\n* sidecar isolate should be executed concurrently\r\n* main isolate should also be executed concurrently, with locks protecting critical regions such as mutating the engine layer tree. But otherwise, it should run freely. By doing this, we are guaranteed that, we can let main isolate run using almost a full cpu core. On the contrary, the \"RenderSuspendable\" approach above will only give, say, 10.67ms out of 16.67ms for heavy widget build/layout, because it need (say) 6ms to paint/rasterize existing things.\r\n\r\n#### What is `ShiftTheChild`\r\n\r\nI want to solve the problem of \"ListView scrolling\". In other words, when scrolling a ListView, the widget build/layout may be arbitrary heavy, while we should get 60fps.\r\n\r\nThus, let us do the following:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nParentWidgets(\r\n  child: ShiftTheChild(\r\n    child: ListView.builder( ... )\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuppose ListView subtree takes 10 frames to rebuild/layout/etc, and suppose the user is scrolling it. Then, during the 10 frames, ShiftTheChild will receive data packets about user dragging and perform a shift (i.e. OffsetLayer's offset) to its child content. ShiftTheChild will be in the sidecar isolate.\r\n\r\nP.S. It may not even be a widget or RenderObject, but may be built on some other lower level primitives mutating corresponding C++ engine Layer. But surely we can wrap those primitives and maybe create a RenderSidecar or something new, that should not be a problem.\r\n\r\n#### Minimal example\r\n\r\nI plan not to implement sidecar isolate in the minimal example. Instead, just create a C++ function that shifts an OffsetLayer in each frame, as if a sidecar isolate is doing so. This is because the sidecar isolate is nontrivial engineering work but is not the core problem.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### UML Diagram\r\n\r\n![UML](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5236035/190575625-cac7fa73-0b80-4808-8414-130446ad8884.png)\r\n",

Given that your suspendable widgets are contagious, we cannot use yield at all (otherwise we will be using it in a big subtree).\r\n\r\nThen in my prototype above I decide to let a Suspendable return zero size when it is near timeout (note: different from your figure, but the problem to solve is similar). But such approach seems not possible for your proposal.\r\n\r\nThis is solved very easily with my \"Dual isolates\" proposal. It just call `safepoint()` in every RenderObject's `layout()`. Then, whenever the C++ code wants to suspend Dart, C++ will just let `safepoint()` hang (probably by occupying a mutex). Then Dart code is just hang there, without doing anything, without feeling anything. In Dart code's view it is like a stop-the-world GC indeed.",

If I understand correctly, seems that @jonahwilliams refuses because \"Splitting the UI thread work into multiple theads is infeasible for several reasons\", such as \"a single thread means that newspace allocations don't need any locking\". However, my proposal above deliberately avoids these problem. In my case, the c++ ui thread is sleeping while dart main isolate is running, and (if flutter does not like multi concurrent isolates) the thread and main isolate can also be sleeping while dart sidecar isolate is running. So, we are still running single isolate, and no lock is needed at all!\r\n\r\nIn short, I am not using multi threading.

(The build phase is wrapped inside layout phase by adding a LayoutBuilder.) Indeed, it does not suspend the paint or raster phase, which should be done in future work.\r\n\r\nGiven the [discord discussions](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101227#issuecomment-1249961627) among @Hixie and @dnfield etc, seems build/layout is mostly the expensive one. So paint or raster may not needed to be considered at the highest priority, at least not implemented in this issue and may defer to future work.\r\n\r\n> It paints nothing (i.e. do not call child.paint) if a Suspendable is suspending. This will destroy the layer tree and C++ engine layer trees, making performance much worse. We should address this problem later, possibly by keeping the layer tree not used but not removed.\r\n\r\nThis is not a problem if we only consider the jank caused by widget creation/deletion (like going to a new page or ListView scroll to make a new widget visible).\r\n\r\n> It lets the whole ancestors (up until relayout-boundary) to relayout in each frame.\r\n\r\nBut I guess this should not be a big problem in real world, because we should keep the heavy things in Suspendable subtrees and keep the ancestors simple.\r\n\r\n> Overhead will become non-neglectable, if we want it to run in 60fps. In other words, if we want each frame to be under 16ms, looks like we will only have <10ms for handling the suspendable widgets (rough estimate, but anyway numbers differ on different phones). Then, the price of 60fps smooth animation is that, the suspendable needs longer time to be loaded.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we want to keep it single-threaded (single isolate), as #110063 (multi isolate) is refused, this is the price we have to pay.\r\n\r\n> If a child under Suspendable mark itself as needed to relayout/rebuild, and there is relayout boundary between that child and Suspendable, then the suspending mechanism will not work at all.\r\n\r\nWe should add more Suspendables if we observe such situation. More specifically, we should add a Suspendable (or, if using `keframe`-like solution, the FrameSeparateWidget) near that specific widget. Then, this is no longer a problem.\r\n\r\np.s. This is not a problem if we only consider the jank caused by widget creation/deletion (like going to a new page or ListView scroll to make a new widget visible).\r\n\r\n> The current implementation does not run suspendable layouts *last*. Instead, they are run inside non-suspendable layout. Thus, we have to set a \"earlier\" deadline (e.g. 12ms, instead of 16.6ms in the example above), and hope that the remaining job will finish quick enough.\r\n\r\nNot a critical problem indeed.\r\n\r\n> [Element.performLayout](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderSliverScrollingPersistentHeader/performLayout.html) says, \"In implementing this function, you must call layout on each of your children\". But, when implementing Suspendable, we have to violate this. We will face troubles, or just minor changes are enough?\r\n\r\nWill see whether it is a problem after doing more experiments.\r\n\r\n> Originally all code (implicitly) assume that, when a frame ends, build/didUpdateWidget has been called. But now this no longer holds. That will make a ton of widget fail to work, including those inside flutter framework, and many external packages. For example, those who assume this inside their addPostFrameCallback.\r\n\r\nSince this feature is completely opt-in (you have to manually put the Suspendable widget into your tree), users may be able to migrate their widgets when they decide to use Suspendable.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, it may take efforts to migrate each and every widget, and it also takes time to migrate all inside flutter framework itself. Luckily, it is opt-in, so we can do it steadily and slowly, just like how we migrate to `Material 3` theme (it has been months but still not finished).\r\n\r\nMany code may migrate smoothly without any problem. (For example, I personally used MobX for my Flutter app, which has reactive states and automatic rebuild, so I seldom touch the raw frame callbacks. For many widgets in flutter framework we can reason about it in our heads and they seem ok as well.)\r\n\r\nWe may need to provide some information to the users, indeed `State`s or `BulidContext`s, telling them they have been suspended. A simple method may be adding a field to `State/BuildContext`, or use a `InheritedWidget`. I may defer this work after seeing what info a real widget wants when migrating real widgets.",

This makes the UI need much longer time to display fully. In addition, it always lag by one frame, because it uses setState in a addPostFrameCallback to update its widget.\r\n\r\n#### The solution\r\n\r\nIMHO, the following suggestion can avoid the problems above. Now it can build/layout as many items as possible until time is up, i.e. have strategy similar to the \"layout\" proposal above. Please correct me if I am wrong!\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in the code example below, the key point is a `LayoutBuilder` wrapped as parent of `FrameSeparateWidget`. By doing so, we ensure that the build *and layout* phase of widgets prior to the current widget has already been done. Now, FrameSeparateWidget can do a simple decision in its `build` method - if time is sufficient just return new child, otherwise return the old one and rebuild in the next frame.\r\n\r\nBy the way, this is partially equivalent to the \"layout\" proposal because of the following: IMHO, the `builder` callback inside a `LayoutBuilder` is called within `performLayout`. Therefore, the `build` of the child widget is strongly related to the `layout` of the LayoutBuilder render object. Then, I can partially migrate the idea in the \"layout\" proposal (where I hacked the performLayout) to this case (where I hack the build).\r\n\r\n#### Full code example and output\r\n\r\nThe dummy `timeRemain` simulates the real world where we may have (e.g.) 16ms for each frame.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n\r\n// ignore_for_file: avoid_print, no_runtimetype_tostring\r\n\r\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\r\nimport 'package:flutter/rendering.dart';\r\nimport 'package:flutter/scheduler.dart';\r\nimport 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';\r\n\r\nlate int timeRemain;\r\n\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  testWidgets('example', (tester) async {\r\n    print('frame #1');\r\n    timeRemain = 3;\r\n    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp(\r\n      home: Column(\r\n        children: [\r\n          for (var i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\r\n            LayoutBuilder(\r\n              builder: (_, __) => FrameSeparateWidget(\r\n                name: '$i',\r\n                child: i.isOdd ?

I think this will not happen\r\n\r\nWell yes the function call is in the same frame; but indeed, if I understand correctly, the *build* will lag one frame. Consider the simplest example, where we are building a new widget tree (thus initState) with a child. Then, in frame 1, FrameSeparateWidget has initState and build called. But it is only at the post-frame callback phase that FrameSeparateWidget.result is filled with the real child. So it is only at frame 2 that FrameSeparateWidget really renders the child onto the screen.\r\n\r\n> Ps: I actually think Fiber and Keframe will end up with similar results, but Keframe will work within the existing framework and won't require a lot of changes to the framework and engine.

Then, because each (new version I proposed yesterday) FrameSeparateWidget builds normally if not timeout, it will behave normally if time is ok; on the contrary, as long as time is up, subtree will pause to build. By doing this, we can ensure every FrameSeparateWidget takes moderate time length (say, 1ms), and there is no such case as one FrameSeparateWidget taking (e.g.) 100ms so everything is jank.",

For the subtree to time out, we can delay the build again by nesting the FrameSeparateWidget, which I've used before. I think from this point of view, all widget builds are interruptible, this Fiber-like mechanism.  I have a crazy idea that if we add a `placholder` property to all widget(Not all, we can add this property to some base class), we will build the `placholder` if the frame `timeRemain` time is 0. Then the jank will never happen ! HHHHH\r\n\r\n> Update: Some experiments here using the new implementation.\r\n\r\nI like your new implementation, which seems to have solved the problem we mentioned earlier by laying out as many widgets as possible in each frame. I think there may be some details that need to be added \uff1a\r\n* Whether other lifecycle states should be considered for `_SmoothState`, such as `didUpdateWidget` or `onDispose`. For example, I encountered an error in keframe when setState was called from outside because `result` was cached in State. If the `widget.child` is changed externally so that it does not work (It doesn't look like it's going to happen because you're using widget.child directly in build, but I think you might need to think about it when using State, I can add a https://github.com/LianjiaTech/keframe/blob/master/example/lib/page/complex_list_example.dart in your example)\r\n* In your example, the height of the item is 24. But for the list, many times we don't know the width and height at code time, and jitter will occur when the placeholder and the actual list are not the same width and height.(because placeholder becomes item, Causing sibling layout changes). like this [example](https://github.com/LianjiaTech/keframe/blob/master/example/lib/page/opt/list_opt_example2.dart) in keframe. I did this by using `SizeCacheWidget` to cache the width and height of the item and force it to the placeholder so that it would not shake the second time the item was displayed. (You can't avoid it the first time, because the Item doesn't have a layout.) Do you have any other ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\n> On the contrary, if we need to modify the framework and it has to be integrated with the framework, then surely we need to put it into flutter framework.\r\n\r\nYes, I think if we do it well enough, we can communicate with the Flutter Team and submit it to the Flutter Framework.  I communicated with @dnfield  a long time ago and he was also interested in it.

        "body": "### New idea: Preemption\r\n\r\n#### Advantages\r\n\r\nIt can nearly achieve my goal: 60fps, no matter how heavy your build/layout are. Without limitations of other approaches, such as the ones in flutter_smooth, or the ones in \"layout\" proposal where the widget subtree has to allow their build/layout not called in some frames.\r\n\r\nIt also *has zero overhead about re-layouting*, i.e. it will *never* need to pay any extra cost to layout, compared to the widget/layout based approaches. It also solves the problem of \"how to suspend a layout\". I can explain more advantages and comparisons if needed.\r\n\r\nCompared with the \"dual isolate\" proposal above, that one seems very hard to implement as it requires threads or coroutines, but this proposal is not. In addition, this proposal eliminate the second \"sidecar\" isolate, and everything is in main isolate, so we can run any code with all data in main isolate memory visible.\r\n\r\n#### Details\r\n\r\nContinue and modified from https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101227#issuecomment-1249005541 (the \"dual isolates\" idea, but without the need of adding new threads (very troublesome to do syncing), or c++ coroutines (troublesome when c++ wants to call dart callback).\r\n\r\nNotice that, the c++ code, main isolate, and sidecar isolate all run on \"ui thread\". No new threads, no coroutines, etc. So this time, the diagram draws nothing but very normal function calls.\r\n\r\nDescription of the figure:\r\n\r\n* vsync comes.\r\n* As normal, C++ calls Dart's drawFrame.\r\n* Suppose Dart has 3 widgets to build/layout. It build/layout the 1st, then 2nd.\r\n* Then it realizes time has up (say, 15ms has come), when `layout()` the 2nd widget. Then it calls `preemptRaster()` (a dart function).\r\n* In `preemptRaster`, we firstly call `preemptModifyLayerTree` to modify the layer tree a bit, like CircularProgressIndicator or the scrolling ListView wrapper widget case, described in \"dual isolate\" proposal above. For simplicity, imagine this `preemptModifyLayerTree` is implemented via very low level API, such as `containerLayer.offset = Offset(10,20)`.\r\n* In `preemptRaster`, we then call a probably modified version of FlutterView.render. In other words, we provide layer tree to C++ code, and c++ code provide it to raster thread. *Notice what layer tree we provide here*: Because `preemptRaster` is called within a `layout()`, the `paint` phase has not started, so the layer tree is completely old (instead of mixed). ThusIn addition, `preemptModifyLayerTree` will modify the layer tree a bit. That's all. We will send this to raster.\r\n* Raster thread renders that layer tree as usual, so we see beautiful things on screen. \r\n* UI thread C++/Dart goes on, because `preemptRaster` function returns. The Dart code will continue from where `preemptRaster` is called (you know, just very plain function calls; but this solves the \"how to suspend a layout call\" implicitly indeed). In Dart's view, it thinks it is still the 1st frame. Let's say it continues layouting the 2nd widget. Then 3rd widget. Then paint, flush compositing bits, semantics, etc.\r\n* Then finally, as a normal pipeline stage, dart provides the new layer tree and let c++ to throw it to the raster thread.\r\n* Raster thread renders it to screen in the background.\r\n* Then, just like what will be done normally in frame 1, call post frame callbacks, c++ calls dart for some callbacks, etc.\r\n* Now ui thread is idle. When next vsync comes, the same loop will go.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n![UML\u65f6\u5e8f\u56fe (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5236035/191271636-f4b8dc2d-8b35-42f5-87b4-42851eb5ef85.png)\r\n\r\n",

So the user has to specify SizeCacheWidget if they want to user ListView. if it's in Flutter framework, we can add it directly, or do you have other ideas?\r\n\r\nThat LGTM. Indeed I will do something like: The `SizeCacheWidget` (I may call it `SmoothParent`) has some inherited widget to provide a controller to its child subtree. Then child can save anything they want to that controller. Anyway, those are simple things, and I can also do it if you like (just need e.g. 15 minutes).\r\n\r\n> Yes, we can get it directly from the engine, but I have to see how to get it in the framework.

The last section in the video (debug animation) is used to verify the file transfer. If that part is seen janky, then it is probably a problem when transferring the video file etc, since that should definitely be 60FPS.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the code is at the GitHub branch mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5236035/192124851-19bae792-ad31-4ae3-8717-8a0821038d00.mp4\r\n\r\n",

If the question is, whether animation happens when the complex widget is being built/layouted, the answer is yes.\r\n\r\n> Because the effect could be replicated by just delaying the complex content build for ~500 ms (animation duration).\r\n\r\nYou need some extra preempt points, instead of a single `sleep(500ms)`. For example, this should work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild() {\r\n  for(var i=0;i<100;++i) {\r\n    Actor.instance.maybePreemptRender();\r\n    sleep(const Duration(milliseconds: 5));\r\n  }\r\n  return your widget;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIndeed, preempt points are auto injected via PreemptPoint, and (possibly done in the real PR) in every RenderObject.layout. So usually no need to manually write that.\r\n\r\nBy the way, your original modification does not work, because by default I do not expect a single widget.build to exceed 16ms. Anyway if that is the case just insert a few `maybePreemptRender`.",
