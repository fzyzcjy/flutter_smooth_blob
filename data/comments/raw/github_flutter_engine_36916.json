I will finish code details, refine code, add tests, make tests pass, etc, after a code review that thinks the *rough idea* is acceptable. It is because, from my past experience, reviews may request changing a lot. If the general idea is to be changed, all detailed implementation efforts are wasted :)\r\n2. The PR has an already-working counterpart, and it produces ~60FPS smooth experimental results. The benchmark results and detailed analysis is in chapter https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/benchmark/. All the source code is in  https://github.com/fzyzcjy/engine/tree/flutter-smooth and https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter/tree/flutter-smooth.\r\n3. Possibly useful as a context to this PR, there is a whole chapter discussing the internals - how flutter_smooth is implemented. (Link: https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/design/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is needed by flutter_smooth in order to handle events. More specifically, when we are in the middle of a long jank frame, flutter_smooth will do preempt render. When doing preempt render, it needs to read and dispatch the pointer events, otherwise the UI will not respond to user fingers at all. \r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_smooth/blob/feat%2Fdoc-insight/website/docs/design/infra/gesture/impl.md\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities.\r\n- [x] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide] and the [C++, Objective-C, Java style guides].\r\n- [x] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.\r\n- [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making or feature I am adding, or Hixie said the PR is test-exempt.
