More specifically, when we are in the middle of a long jank frame, flutter_smooth will do preempt render. When doing preempt render, it needs to read and dispatch the pointer events, otherwise the UI will not respond to user fingers at all. \r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_smooth/blob/feat%2Fdoc-insight/website/docs/design/infra/gesture/impl.md\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities.\r\n- [x] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide] and the [C++, Objective-C, Java style guides].\r\n- [x] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.\r\n- [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making or feature I am adding, or Hixie said the PR is test-exempt.
