However, it looks reasonable to allow the user to know when the ticker thinks it *starts* ticking.\r\n\r\nIf this does not wanted to be widely used, maybe we can mark it as `@protected` or `@visibleForTesting` or [`@experimental`](https://pub.dev/documentation/meta/latest/meta/experimental-constant.html).\r\n\r\nAs for where it is needed inside flutter_smooth, it is utilized to know the relative time between a few Tickers as well as the system. In other words, when Ticker A says it elapsed 1 second, flutter_smooth needs to know the startTime such that it knows what \"1second\" means in absolute time.
