I will finish code details, refine code, add tests, make tests pass, etc, after a code review that thinks the *rough idea* is acceptable. It is because, from my past experience, reviews may request changing a lot. If the general idea is to be changed, all detailed implementation efforts are wasted :)\r\n2. The PR has an already-working counterpart, and it produces ~60FPS smooth experimental results. The benchmark results and detailed analysis is in chapter https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/benchmark/. All the source code is in  https://github.com/fzyzcjy/engine/tree/flutter-smooth and https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter/tree/flutter-smooth.\r\n3. Possibly useful as a context to this PR, there is a whole chapter discussing the internals - how flutter_smooth is implemented. (Link: https://cjycode.com/flutter_smooth/design/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nThis works together with a few other PRs: https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36438 (to support multi render), https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36837 (which consumes vsync tagret time).\r\n\r\nIn order to make https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36837 and other Flutter logic work, we need to provide the correct vsync target time. However, currently the fallback target time is filled as the current time, which is surely incorrect and caused bugs for things like https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36837.\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities.\r\n- [x] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide] and the [C++, Objective-C, Java style guides].\r\n- [x] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.\r\n- [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making or feature I am adding, or Hixie said the PR is test-exempt.
